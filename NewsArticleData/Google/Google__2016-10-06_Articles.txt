The expectation and the hope is that Google probably would let bygones be bygones, but the messaging and texting app may not have a foot in the door in just a couple of months. In fact, on December 1, Google will actually remove Hangouts from the core Google Mobile Services package and replace the app with its new video chatting service, Duo. The “gapps” package is what gets pre-loaded from Google on all Android smartphones. The change was announced in an email obtained by Android Police. “Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products,” Google stated. That means that manufacturers can opt to have the app pre-loaded with the rest of the package, but, as David Ruddock points out: There’s also no guarantee that manufacturers will stop bundling the Hangouts app on their devices, but I would strongly assume that’s likely – OEMs and mobile operators want to push their own messaging solutions, or those of partners paying for placement on their devices, and Hangouts was competition. Interestingly, Allo is not required in the GMS package, though it may be more complicated to sell as a chat app than Google’s own barebones, SMS-based Messenger app — yet, it’s also not in gapps. Google claims that Hangouts for Android will still receive support as the product is right now, though we could see more changes that could suit it for business as opposed to general communications.

There’s nothing on the router’s spec sheet that just quite mentions what’s going on with the power adapter, — other than it has a 15W maximum, but the device only consumes 9W — but Leung announced that USB-C connectors are on the adapt. In fact, its configured to the same 5V, 3A spec that Google chose for the Pixel C. “You could just as easily use [the adapter] to charge one of your new Type-C phones,” Leung posted on his Google+ page, “and conversely, use your phone’s 15W power adapter to power Google WiFi.” Source: Google+, Google Via: juggly.cn (Google Translate) Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Because ‘six seconds is more than enough’ Update: DDoS attack on Dyn DNS leaves internet crippled Advertising and Media / Advertising & Marketing / Google Pixel is a physical search bar, according to ad By Staff Reporter on 6 October, 2016 Memeburn Share Google doesn’t do subtle any more. Sure, Google Tricks weren’t exactly marks of elegance, nor are the coy names for its Google Pixel smartphones’ colours. But the company sure knows how to make an advertisement, regardless of how obvious the metaphor is. Published shortly after the Pixels’ launch on 4 October, and airing on US television a few hours after, Google’s new advertisement shows the progression of the company, from a humble internet search engine to the behemoth it is today. Google is evolving to keep its core business fresh, and Google Pixel is evidence of that And the metaphor? A literal shape-shifting search bar. It uses a quite literal search bar, which morphs from a horizontal rectangle, to a more Google Nexus-shaped tablet, and finally, a Google Pixel. It’s quite smart, and does shed light on how the company is fundamentally evolving into a true Microsoft and Apple competitor, without forgetting its real strengths. But before I give the entire ad away, have a look at what Google believes will be the new future of the company in the coming years. Also, if you missed the Google Pixel launch this week, be sure to visit Gearburn for an extensive recap of the event.

But all that is just a bunch of bluster if we can’t see actual results. Soon after Google’s event this week, Phandroid posted over 100 images taken with the search giant’s new Pixel devices. You can see all of them in the gallery above. The Pixel comes with a 12.3-megapixel camera featuring an f/2.0 aperture and 1.55 micron pixels. “Our team of photography gurus and image processing experts have spent the last year designing and tirelessly optimizing our entire camera stack,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai. “Pixel’s camera lets you take stunning photos in low light, bright light or any light,” Pichai added. “Catch action shots as they happen with Smartburst, which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best one. Use Lens Blur to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, making your subject pop. Google’s Pixel also offers manual settings, giving users more control over exposure, white balance, and more. All of this adds up to the best smartphone camera Google has ever made. The images above certainly look impressive but as Phandroid notes a lot of them have been edited using Snapseed and VSCO Cam. We’ll get a better idea of what the pictures straight out of the Pixel when we get our hands on a retail unit later this month.

The more upbeat the music, the more the listener will be motivated to push harder. And now Google is helping to fuel high-intensity workouts by providing the soundtrack to the user's next workout. Google teamed up with the fitness tracking app Runtastic to give Android users workout-inspired playlists that are powered by Play Music. Google Play Music's fitness playlist include a variety of different songs including those that are more than 130 beats per minute, which is the perfect tempo to synchronize with exercise to get the listener's heart rate up, burn calories and work up a sweat. Not only will the playlist keep users pumped since its consists of their favorite songs, but it will also be easier to forget about the burn and get lost in the music. The best part of it is that the Google Play Music ad-free playlists are available for Android users with the Runtastic app for free. While of course this seems to be like a great way to get more users on board Google's music streaming service, Android users don't need to have an account in order to jam along with this partnership. Starting on Friday, Oct. 7, users who launch the Runtastic app can start streaming Google Play Music's fitness playlists that are relevant to their activity. These include "Today's Running Hits" with music from Calvin Harris and Alesso, "Sweaty EDM Workout" with music from Avicii and Armin van Buuren, and "High-Energy Hard Rock" with music from Kings of Leon and The Black Keys. The songs play directly in the Runtastic app so that users can play, pause or skip while keeping track of their workout from one centralized location. This feature could help recruit new users who have Spotify or Apple Music and don't want to keep exiting and launching the two apps and interrupting their workouts. And while the playlists are free for Android users, Google is making sure iOS users don't miss out on what its streaming service has to offer. It announced that it is giving Runtastic users on both Android and iOS devices a free trial to Play Music so that they can stream creating their own playlists to work out to. The ability to stream Google Play Music playlists from Runtastic is now available in more than 60 countries worldwide.

In a world where we rely on nearly 7 billion small screens that’s a tall order--but we’re toasting the first anniversary of AMP with progress the entire initiative can feel good about. From day one, a key focus for AMP has been speed.  Slow loading sites are arguably one of the most frustrating things about the mobile web. Recent Google research shows that 53% of people will leave a site that fails to load in three seconds or less. That’s the worst of all worlds for users, businesses, publishers, websites and the mobile web as a whole. For publishers, who were the first to get on board with AMP, the benefits of fast-loading content are super-tangible. In this case study, the Washington Post reported a 23% increase in mobile search users who return within 7 days. And in this case study, one of Europe’s biggest native advertising platforms, plista, conducted its own experiment among premium publishers like n-tv.de, faz.net, abendzeitung.de, and golem.de to measure AMP’s impact on web app widget speed and profitability. Average click-through rates for publishers improved by 220%, while one saw an increase of 600% after the implementation of AMP. To date the AMP project has been a story about momentum. This is clear in everything from the pace of releases of the open source code to the number of participants embracing the AMP format. From Pinterest to Reddit to Bing and Ebay, reports of success after adopting AMP have rolled in in recent months. At Google, we’re doing our part too. In February, we launched AMP in the “Top Stories” section of Google Search, delivering news in a fast and reliable way. In August, we previewed linking to AMPs across the entire mobile search results page. And this month we’re excited to be rolling out that faster experience to mobile users across Europe. Now when you search on your mobile device, you’ll see a label that indicates a page is AMP’d. This doesn’t change Search results but will show you which sites have pages that are ready to load lightning fast. Today AMP pages load from Google Search in less than one second on average. Beyond just saving time with fast loading pages, AMP also saves data -- AMP pages on Search use 10 times less data than the equivalent non-AMP page. To date we have over 600 million AMP documents created by sites all over the world (232 locales and 104 languages). These pages cover news content, retail, travel, recipes, general knowledge and entertainment. That’s a lot of fast-loading pages! The open source initiative is thriving because there is a strong community behind it getting involved in everything from working groups to contributing to the Github page with suggestions, feedback and code spec. While the first year of the AMP Project has gotten off to a good start, there still remains a lot of work ahead.  This roadmap is a good way to stay up to date on what is happening next. We look forward to returning in a year’s time with even more awesome progress as we work together to make the web great for everyone.

Google Pixel phone vs Sony Xperia XZ: Which is best for me? By Chris Barraclough 7th Oct 2016 Features Sony Xperia X Series Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones Tweet We compare the new 'made by Google' Pixel phone, with Sony's 2016 flagship mobile the Xperia XZ. What's the difference in terms of specs, camera tech and other features, and which one is best for you? Here's our Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ comparison review. Just this week, Google pulled back the curtain on its 5-inch flagship Pixel phone, packing premium specs for a super-premium price. The Pixel boasts a sharp and colourful Full HD screen, the latest Snapdragon processor and a powerful 12-megapixel camera, but it's also just as expensive as other flagship phones like Apple's iPhone 7 and the Samsung Galaxy S7. So how does the Pixel compare with Sony's Xperia XZ, another super-powered Android handset that just hit the UK last month? Here's our full Pixel vs Xperia XZ comparison review to help you decide. And have a gander at our full hands-on review of the 5-inch Pixel phone, to learn more. Check out our hands-on Pixel XL review too, where we share our first thoughts on the super-sized 5.5-inch version of the Pixel phone. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Specs at a glance Phone Google Pixel Sony Xperia XZ Screen size 5-inches 5.2-inches Screen resolution Full HD 1920x1080 Full HD 1920x1080 Weight 143g 161g Fingerprint sensor? Yes Yes Water resistant? No Yes OS Android 7.1 Nougat Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow Processor Snapdragon 821 Snapdragon 820 Memory 4GB 4GB Storage 32/128GB 32/64GB MicroSD? No Yes Battery 2770mAh 2900mAh Rear camera 12-megapixel 23-megapixel Front camera 8-megapixel 13-megapixel Price From £599 From £500 Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Design Sony's Xperia XZ is a proper hand-filler, although just about usable one-handed. Those rounded edges makes it quite comfortable to hold, while the matte metallic surfacing gives an attractive finish in a selection of shades. It's not impervious to scratches sadly, although these are difficult to see unless the light catches the phone just right. Google's Pixel phone is more compact and a little lighter too, with a slender design that's well suited to one-handed use. Around the back you'll find an unusual blend of glass and metal, which certainly stands out from the rest of the smartphone crowd. It feels quite hardy but we'll be testing that out when we use the Pixel phone as our full-time handset. The Pixel phone isn't water resistant, unlike the Xperia XZ, so you probably shouldn't check your Twitter feed in the bath or anything. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Screen and media Both the Pixel phone and the HTC 10 sport a sharp Full HD screen, which means you'll struggle to make out individual pixels. With either handset you get rich colours that really pop and bring images to life. And both phones will be easy to use in harsh sunlight, thanks to those powerful brightness levels. Sony's Xperia XZ also supports Hi-Res audio when your plug in headphones, for a super-detailed musical experience. In our brief play, the Pixel phone didn't seem to offer the same support. The Pixel phone also doesn't have a microSD memory card slot so you can't expand the on-board storage. Although there is a 128GB model, if you've got £699 hanging around in your wallet. Thankfully the XZ does support microSD, so you can fill up a massive card with loads of movies and more. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: OS and features Sony's Xperia XZ still uses Android Marshmallow, which was released last year, just like every other flagship Android from 2016. But the Pixel phone comes with the latest Android Nougat pre-installed - no surprise, as this is a 'made by Google' mobile. This gives you Google's new Assistant AI straight out of the box, which is basically a step beyond Google Now with its context-aware helpfulness. Of course, the Xperia XZ should get an update to full Nougat soon, but you won't get the Assistant feature because Google is saving that for Pixel handsets alone. Bums. The good news for gamers is that the Xperia XZ does support Remote Play, which means you can stream your PS4 gaming sessions straight to your phone. You can even pair your PS4 controller, with zero latency to spoil the show. Both phones pack a fingerprint sensor, to quickly and securely unlock to your desktops. On the Xperia XZ this is mounted on the edge, while the Pixel phone's is stuck around the back. Both are easy and intuitive to use. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Performance and battery life Gamers and media fans will enjoy a smooth everyday performance from the Xperia XZ, thanks to the Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM stuffed inside. We're not expecting to see any sign of slowdown any time soon. That said, the new Pixel phone uses the latest Snapdragon 821 processor, which promises a ten percent increase in performance over the old 820 chipset. In terms of real-life experience, there's unlikely to be any real difference between these two mobiles, at least for some time - but in a year or two, the Pixel may be the smoother operator of these two. As for battery life, the Xperia XZ gives you at least a day of heavy use per charge. And of course it supports fast charging, to get you powered up and ready to rock in no time at all. We're yet to test the Pixel phone's battery life, but early word is that the Pixel can keep going for even longer. Fast charging is again supported, while both handsets use Type-C USB for power and data transfer. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Cameras When we get our review sample of the Pixel phone we'll be thoroughly testing the 12-megapixel rear camera, but in our hands-on tests it certainly seems to be a worthy flagship snapper. You can take rapid-fire shots and there's zero shutter lag, just like on the iPhone 7's excellent camera. Just tap and your photo takes instantly. Our test photos were pleasingly detailed, although unlikely to beat the Xperia XZ's output. Sony's 23-megapixel camera really impresses with its sharp, attractive images, and the XZ's new triple-sensor tech works well in low-light conditions. Check out our in-depth Xperia XZ camera review for full samples and more. Both of these phones can capture up to 4K resolution video, with strong image stabilisation to cut down on shakes and judders. If you shoot a lot of home movies, you don't need to lean towards one phone or the other. Google Pixel phone vs Xperia XZ: Price and verdict When it comes to cost, the Xperia XZ and Google Pixel phone both pack a premium price. However, it's possible to pick up the Xperia XZ on contract for less cash than the Pixel, and in terms of specs and features there's not a massive gap between them. You can grab the Sony Xperia XZ from O2, from £37 per month with no up-front cost. Check out our round-up of the best Pixel phone UK deals. Stay tuned for our full Google Pixel phone review.

Home News Apps Hangouts demoted in Google Apps package, Duo gets nod Hangouts won't be mandatory on Google partner phones soon, Duo will be By: Sean Ridgeley | Apps News | Posted: Oct 7, 2016 11:26 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Google recent sent out an e-mail to its Mobile Services partners indicating Hangouts will no longer be required to be bundled with hardware. Rather, video calling app Duo will take its place.     "Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products," it reads. "This change will take effect on December 1, 2016."   What's also interesting is Google's text messaging app Allo isn't getting the nod alongside Duo; for whatever reason, the company is content to not push the text side of their new communication apps in this regard, at least for the time being.   In any case, Google will continue to support Hangouts; it simply won't be mandatory anymore on partner hardware.

The Internet giant has had stores inside stores. But it does not — at least not yet — have the equivalent of Apple stores. But the introduction of a high-end line of hardware marks a new era for the Internet giant and there's the hint that a more ambitious brick-and-mortar retail strategy may be in the making. Google is in the midst of a new and very aggressive push to sell its own consumer electronic devices, rather than supplying the software to manufacturers. © Jessica Guynn, for USA TODAY Google's new consumer electronics devices will be displayed in a pop-up shop in New York City on Oct. 20. Pop-up shops are a common prelude to establishing a bigger retail presence. That's what Microsoft did with Xbox and Surface and Samsung has also done pop-ups for the holidays. "It seems inevitable that they need some kind of hardware presence to show this stuff off in a consistent and joined-up way," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research. The challenge? Opening retail outlets is a costly and time-consuming endeavor if Google wants to reach a significant chunk of the U.S. population, Dawson said. "Look at Apple – it launched its first stores 15 years ago, has been ramping up steadily since, and still has under 300 US stores. Microsoft is an even more relevant and a more recent example," he said. "If you’re willing to sacrifice some of the premium in the retail experience, you can roll out more quickly – Microsoft has around 100 US stores. But Microsoft can show off both its own devices and third party devices – I’m not sure Google could reasonably do the same in its retail stores." Among the Google devices that will be on display: the new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, virtual reality headset Daydream View, Google Home smart speaker and Google WiFi.

If you want the Play Store on the phones you make, then you need to play ball with Google - and, among other things, agree to preinstall a certain list of apps. This changes from time to time, and come December 1 it will change once more. From that point on, Google Duo will become a mandatory preinstall for Android phones, replacing Hangouts in that role. Hangouts will be an optional preinstall, meaning some manufacturers may choose to ship it with their devices, but most probably won't. On the other hand, this means Duo will come preinstalled on every single Android handset released after December 1. So those market share gains it's made already are only going to get bigger. Obviously this doesn't mean Hangouts is dead per se, but unbundling it from the mandatory Google apps package is yet another step in the search giant's strategy of making this a business communications platform of sorts - and not a consumer-oriented product. When it comes to messaging, that role now goes to Allo, Google's umpteenth effort in this space, and yet another try at competing with Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger. Oddly though, Allo is not part of the aforementioned Google apps list, at least not yet.

Graham For Dailymail.com Published: 18:49 EST, 7 October 2016 | Updated: 07:20 EST, 8 October 2016 e-mail 3.5k shares 490 View comments WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange promised 'significant' disclosures on subjects including the U.S. election and Google in the coming weeks as the secret-spilling group marked its 10th anniversary on Tuesday. Assange said WikiLeaks plans to start publishing new material starting this week, but wouldn't specify the timing and subject and warned that the so called 'October Surprise' may expose Google. The war between Assange and the tech giant started in 2014 when he wrote about the company in his book titled, 'When Google Met Wikileaks', according to Recode. 'Nobody wants to acknowledge that Google has grown big and bad,' Assange wrote in the book.  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (pictured in 2016) promised 'significant' disclosures on subjects including the U.S. election and Google in the coming weeks as the secret-spilling group marked its 10th anniversary on Tuesda Assange (pictured above on Tuesday) said WikiLeaks plans to start publishing new material starting this week 'But it has. Schmidt's tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation.'  Assange became concerned about former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's ties with the State Department in 2009 when Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of state. He has claimed that Schmidt, who is a chairman at the company, has worked with the Clintons for years, as Donald Trump accused Google of political bias saying that it suppresses negative news about Clinton.   Speaking by video link to an anniversary news conference in Berlin earlier this week, he said the leaks include 'significant material' on war, arms, oil, internet giant Google, the U.S. election and mass surveillance. WikiLeaks hopes 'to be publishing every week for the next 10 weeks,' Assange said. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next BREAKING NEWS: Vladimir Putin publicly accused by U.S....

Share this article Share Assange wrote in his 2014 book that 'Schmidt's (file above) tenure as CEO saw Google integrate with the shadiest of U.S. power structures as it expanded into a geographically invasive megacorporation' The group, which released Democratic National Committee emails days before the party's national convention earlier this year, wouldn't say who or what campaign would be affected by the upcoming U.S. election leaks.  Assange said speculation that he or WikiLeaks intend to harm Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is 'false.' Asked whether he feels any personal affinity with Clinton's Republican rival, Donald Trump, Assange replied: 'I feel personal affinity really, I think, with all human beings.' 'I certainly feel sorry for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,' he added. 'These are two people that are tormented by their ambitions in different ways.' Assange claimed that Schmidt has worked with the Clintons for years, as Donald Trump accused Google (file) of political bias saying that it suppresses negative news about Clinton  Wikileaks came to prominence a decade ago by publishing classified documents that related to prisoners in the United States' Guantanamo Bay, NSA surveillance of world leaders and military operations in Afghanistan.  In addition, millions of diplomatic and military files were made public by Wikileaks from US soldier Chelsea Manning who is currently serving a 35-year prison term for leaking the information.  Sweden is seeking Assange's extradition in a rape investigation.  He hasn't left the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012.  Assange denies the rape allegation and says he fears being extradited to the U.S. to face espionage charges if he leaves.

Turns out that was partially true. As of the 1st of December, Google will no longer require Hangouts to be preinstalled on Android phones. This is according to an email sent to the company’s Mobile Services partners, in which Google made a change to the core GMS package. “Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016.” In case you did not know, Google usually requires OEMs to bundle a suite of Google apps/services if they want to use Android on their phones. For a while now Hangouts was one of the default apps but like the email reads, Hangouts will no longer be a required app and will be replaced by Duo. This doesn’t mean that Hangouts is dead. OEMs still have the option of bundling Hangouts if they want, but they are just no longer required to. Interestingly enough we had always assumed that if anything, Allo would be a more suitable replacement for Hangouts, not Duo. n the meantime Google is expected to focus Hangouts on its business users.

For one, Nexus devices had little visibility in their absence at relevant carrier stores around the globe, but other forms of ads were never really pushed either. Chances are you’ve never seen a giant Nexus billboard on the road, and it would be hard for you to remember an ad box inside of a newspaper. But nobody, starting with Google, ever expected that to happen, either; Nexus phones were not meant to be iPhone or Galaxy S rivals, if not on the spec sheet and quality-wise. Pixel, however, is a rather different story. A story that is ostensibly starting just now, as both the two Chromebook Pixels and the Pixel C haven’t enjoyed the limelight too much either. We actually started seeing this before the Pixel and Pixel XL were even a thing; Google flexed its advertising muscle to let people know that… it was hosting an event. It is something very few other companies do, like Apple or Samsung with its usual “#TheNextGalaxy” campaign. And, now that the gates have been opened, Google is doubling down on what is arguably its flagship product. I am lucky enough to live in London, and given that the UK has been selected among the first markets where Google will sell its devices, I’m already seeing this commitment imprinted in the environment around me. And what struck me is not just the seeming ubiquity of these ads, but the actual kind of places I saw them. Save for the usual carrier store, I saw the Pixel advertised on massive billboards, the front page of the free newspaper handed out to hundreds and hundreds of people at the entrance of every London Underground station, and even in the massive area opposed to the trains’ platform — a spot usually destined to the iPhone. We also know that Google is planning to open a pop-up store in New York City come October 20th, and that will run through the holidays. Also, as per a Reuters report, the whole advertising campaign for television will start with a massive $3.2M spending, with more to come. Even Mario Queiroz, Google’s Vice President of Product Management, told Reuters that it was a “very significant marketing campaign”, also alluding at potential million-dollar-worth ads to show during the Thanksgiving football games. This is certainly a noteworthy shift in Google’s strategy, and a clear reflection of Rick Osterloh’s words at this week’s past event: Google is serious about hardware and the whole “Made by Google” thing, which is definitely not a one-off shot; they are in it ‘for the long run’. Take a look at a few shots down below. This is Old Street, where this massive four-faced billboard only shows Google-related stuff. As of now, the four screens are entirely dedicated to the Pixel. This is a “standard” ad outside one of EE’s store. This is Oxford Street, however, where literally thousands of people walk by every day. Front page of The Evening Standard, a free newspaper you can find at each of the tube’s stops. Part one of a massive ad inside of Bond Street’s station — a pretty crowded one, I assure you. Part 2.

Google's Panoramio photo-sharing service bids farewell 0 Share: Photography by Stephen Shankland October 7, 2016 2:29 PM PDT @stshank Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Enlarge Image The Panoramio website, closing November 4, 2016, caught on among those who liked seeing photos linked to real-world locations.Photo by Screenshot by Stephen Shankland/CNET Google will put photo-sharing site Panoramio out of its misery in a month, a decision that triggered fresh anguish and anger among people who have stuck with it through thick and thin. This week, Panoramio fans saw the words "Panoramio is closing," with a November 4 deadline. As word spread from a post by a Panoramio forum moderator, outrage and sadness ensued. You might have never heard of Panoramio, but you've probably benefited from the site. Its photos have been a prime source of imagery on Google Maps. It worked because Panoramio was early to embrace location tagging that lets you see photos of a specific spot. Panoramio, acquired in 2007, and Picasa, acquired in 2004, were early Google forays into online photo sharing, but Google is phasing both out in favor of Google Photos. Communities dramatically improve online services by adding valuable content at no cost to the company, recruiting new members and building social ties that give a service staying power. But those advantages become problems when it's time to shut a community down, even one that only a tiny fraction of a company's users embrace. The death of Panoramio is no surprise. In 2014, Google tried to scrap Panoramio. Facing more the wrath of more than 10,000 displeased petitioners, the company commuted Panoramio's death sentence in 2015, but it was clear the site wasn't a priority. Despite the downward trajectory, some users remained loyal though. Feeling betrayed, some of them now seem eager to spite Google. Digital-age photography How Google hopes its Pixel camera will win over iPhone fans Yahoo's Flickr app now supports Apple's 3D Touch ​iPhone owners can recoup their costs with 500px camera app "I have millions of views, some photos with more than 100,000 views, achieved Level 5 local guide badge, I've reported tons of errors in maps and now? They're saying me goodbye. We don't need you anymore, because we are accepting only photos of restaurants now," said user PavolG on the forum. "I'm glad I deleted most of my photos two years ago so that I had only 20 photos left to delete today. My former Picasa albums will follow," wrote user c0l0gne1. Google didn't respond to a request for comment. There are abundant photo-sharing communities today for those who don't like Google Photos, including Yahoo's Flickr, Facebook's Instagram, and 500px. One that seems to have caught on among Panoramio refugees is French photo-sharing site Ipernity. It seems to have some of the community-friendly features Panoramio users liked.

Duo, Google’s new video chat app, will take the place of Hangouts. As a result, Duo will come pre-installed on every single new Android smartphone released in 2017 and beyond. It’s important to note this does not mean Google is preparing to shut down Hangouts — though the company has already noted it plans to remake Hangouts into a business-to-business offering. Moreover, OEMs can continue to pre-install Hangouts should they choose to do so. Hangouts will also continue to be available on the Google Play Store. That said, it’s still a telling move on the part of Google. While Hangouts may have its fans, the company is now clearly more concerned with the success of Allo, its new AI assisted chat app, and Duo. On that note, Google has not added Allo to the list of required GMS apps, though it’s likely that move is forthcoming. SourceAndroid Police Roger I like Hangout because I can use it from my Gmail of Inbox page. I hope they’ll find a way to integrate Allo in a similar fashion when/if they shut down Hangouts for personal use. Shawn I am surprised they didn’t add Allo also with Dou immediately. Something must have been uncertain when the paperwork was being drawn up. John W Allo is still in testing Shawn Why do you think this? Was this stated somewhere? John W Hmm i read that somewhere that it was widely available now but not final yet. Shawn I sideloaded Allo when it came out. I saw someone say something that made me wonder if my version was up to date or not. When I looked at the version number I noticed it listed the version number as “1.0.006_RC18.” Part of me sees Release Candidate 18 and it makes me wonder if this is confirmation of what you were saying. The other part of me thinks that RC18 was the one that was selected, and they simply didn’t remove the RC designator because that would be changing the file. southerndinner Until Duo properly supports multiple devices at the same time like virtually all of its competition, I have absolutely no interest in it. fred Bad decision. Hangouts works just fine. Better than Duo. Ipse Voice calls to phone numbers….anyone? This goes the way of the Dodo bird and Google Voice. Maybe Google can ASK users what THEY want…. Brad Fortin “As a result, Duo will come pre-installed on every single new Android smartphone released in 2017 and beyond.” … or until Google releases *another* new messaging platform. Probably at the next I/O. Can’t Fix Stupid Googles Apps and Android strategies are an inconsistent mess. Google Now for photos…nope it’s now over in Google photos. Project Aura…nope shelved. Allo, Duo…hangouts? Who knows. Nexus gone. Pixel? How about some Apple prices.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:55 AM, October 8, 2016 Google's new "Pixel" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics<005930.KS> and Apple Inc <AAPL.O>. Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's<GOOGL.O> Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc <VZ.N>, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

MacDailyNews Take: Google attempting to mimic the style of Apple’s iPhone ads seems entirely appropriate since they are trying to mimic the iPhone itself and have been since Eric Schmidt sat on Apple’s BoD taking copious notes. Google’s Pixel phones cost about the same as real Apple iPhones, but: – Benchmark only about half as fast as the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus – Lack Optical Image Stabilization like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus – XL lacks a telephoto lens like the iPhone 7 Plus – Lack water-resistance like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus – Lack a wide color gamut display like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (which is rated “perfect” by DisplayMate) – Lack Haptic feedback like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus – Lack 3D Touch like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus – Lack stereo speakers like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus – Is available only on Verizon in the U.S. which will not allow direct updates from Google unlike Apple’s direct updates for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus – Lack physical locations for customers to get support like the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus In the future (while Google is still making them and haven’t axed the project like basically everything they’re ever tried) anyone you see who’s carrying a Google Pixel phone either works for Alphabet or doesn’t know jack shit about technology. As we wrote yesterday: The general media’s coverage of Google’s latest “first phone by Google” seems slanted in favor of Google for some reason. Perhaps it’s because Google controls the vast majority of online advertising dollars? When the media seems to be selling you a narrative that simply does not match the facts, follow the money.

What a cheap knockoff piece of ass. Google is for geek losers and copycats. whatever Friday, October 7, 2016 - 5:21 pm · Reply Well that ad agency USED to work with Apple – They should be ashamed for copying previous work – Google should have used a different agency..

Homeandmantel Saturday, October 8, 2016 - 3:47 pm · Reply Yep. That’s the biggest thing reviewers forget to mention, the inherent liability that is Android. You can make the nicest shiniest case but if it still runs Android then it’s an automatic fail. Homeandmantel Friday, October 7, 2016 - 6:07 pm · Reply This things is going to bomb. They probably know that’s the case, and want to set the ground work for future models, but there is no way this thing is going to sell but to the most hardcore Google fanboys.(..that can afford them) Up In Smoke Friday, October 7, 2016 - 6:16 pm · Reply Will they try to mold the minds of the sorry saps by burning $15 billion a year in “marketing” like Samesongbombs? Charlie Saturday, October 8, 2016 - 7:50 am · Reply So all this time the tech world was going on about Apple not changing the iPhone 6 design was so that Google can copy it and say it’s their design. So much for believing all the shit the media throws at us. They are in Bed with Google and should never ever be trusted. Just like the world told us we need AMOLED and then you go and read displaymates review on the iPhone 7 display and that it is perefect and who told us we need AMOLED? Seriously let’s stop believing any shit we hear from YouTube reviewers who are young boys who know nothing about tech and the media that seems to worship the ground Google/Samsung walks on. I am sure Samsung is paying the world to believe AMOLED Display so they can get the contract on AMOLED orders and we keep. Elite I got the shit we are being sold by SAMSUNG AND GOOGLE. I SAY NO MORE. Apple you do your thing and let no amount of pressure influence your road map. Go Apple. Where is Apple answer to google search and YouTube. Not everybody uses Siri and I am truly tired of getting googles answer to anything I type in and I tried yahoo and the other search engines. We are getting a bias view of Apple aslong as people keep using google search and YouTube. Ed. Floden Saturday, October 8, 2016 - 11:30 am · Reply Maybe Google would have success if they called it “iPxel”. Derek Currie Saturday, October 8, 2016 - 12:22 pm · Reply … This ad-blast routine for a crap product is sooo familiar. Therefore, my familiar response: Spend Google! Spend SPEND SPEND!

Google this week said that substantial progress has been made with the open-source Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) initiative in the one year since it launched last October. The AMP project is a Google-led effort to enable a faster mobile web. Under the effort, the company is trying to get website owners to implement the AMP protocol for creating lightweight web pages for mobile devices. The project is part of a Digital News Initiative that Google launched last year for publishers in Europe but is now being applied on a broader scale. Publishers who were the first to get on AMP have seen substantial benefits from having fast-loading mobile content, David Besbris, Google's vice president of search and AMP, wrote on the company's Europe blog. As one example, Besbris pointed to the Washington Post, which after implementing AMP has seen a 23 percent increase in mobile users who return within one week. The Post currently publishes more than 1,000 AMP-enabled articles each day, and nearly 55 percent of online traffic comes from mobile users. Since implementing AMP, page load times are 88 percent faster than they were with its previous mobile website, the Post claimed in a case study posted on the AMP project website. Average page load times are now just 400 milliseconds, the Post said. The boost in page load times from AMP has benefited publishers in other ways as well, Besbris said. A study conducted by Plista, one of Europe's largest advertising platforms, showed that average click-through rate for publishers jumped a whopping 220 percent for sites that had implemented AMP, he said. "To date the AMP project has been a story about momentum," Besbris said. In addition to more websites implementing the protocol, the pace of code releases for the open-source protocol has also kept growing, he said. In the one year since the AMP project launched, website owners around the world have created over 600 million AMP documents in 104 languages. In addition to publishers, other sites such as retail, travel and recipe websites have implementing the protocol, he said. For its part, Google has been trying to encourage adoption of AMP by highlighting pages that have been enabled for the protocol in mobile search, Besbris said. Now when users search for content using their smartphones or tablets, they will see an AMP icon to indicate pages that will load faster on their devices. For the moment at least, Google has said that AMP will not have a direct impact on how it ranks mobile search engine results. But going forward, the company has indicated that it will favor websites and web pages that have been optimized for the mobile web over sites that have not. In addition to highlighting search results, Google has also launched AMP-enabled stories in the "Top Stories" portion in Google Search on mobile. Google has cast AMP largely as an effort that will benefit internet users, publishers and website owners in general. But the company also has a lot to gain from enabling a faster web experience for mobile users. As a company that derives almost all of its revenues and profits from online advertising, Google stands to profit from having web pages—and the ads that go along with those pages—load faster on mobile devices. Google's own research shows that 53 percent of users will abandon a site or web page if it fails to load within 3 seconds.           LATEST ENTERPRISE APPS ARTICLES   Windows 10 Sticky Notes Grow More Insightful in More Languages Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters IBM Launches Project Intu for Embodied Cognition Microsoft Releases First SharePoint Server Feature Pack Google to Shelve Free Map Maker Tool                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Node.js Is Helping Developers Get the Most Out of JavaScript Microsoft Surface Devices Challenge Apple in Enterprise Strongholds Apple's New MacBook Pros Leave Analysts Wanting More Microsoft Releases Skype for Business Mac Client Microsoft Blasts Google for Early Disclosure of Windows Bug Comparing Microsoft's Surface Studio ...

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) (Eric Risberg) Print Email Wilborn P. Nobles III, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Wilborn P. Nobles III, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 07, 2016 at 3:45 PM comments A car crash involving one of Google's driverless cars landed its test driver in the hospital in September, according to a report from Quartz.com. In Google's monthly self-driving car report released Thursday (Oct. 6), the Internet search giant said another vehicle ran a red light and slammed into the right side of its Lexus SUV on Sept. 23. The driverless car was moving through a green light when it "detected another vehicle traveling" at 30 mph, according to the report. Google's car applied the brakes "in anticipation that the other vehicle would run through the red light," but the report added that the driver then took manual control of the car.  The report does not address if the test driver made the right call, but the website said the phrasing of the report suggests the driver interfered with the car's ability to avoid a crash. Although the report said no injuries were reported, the driver later "voluntarily went to a local hospital" where he was later released. The report from Google comes as companies begin to put driverless technology on the road despite safety concerns among critics and federal regulators alike. In February, Google admitted fault when one of its driverless cars collided with a bus in California. Google currently has 58 driverless vehicles operating in four different states, in which they have driven more than 2 million miles.

The company is on track to reach 45 metros total by the end of 2016. By Conner Forrest | October 7, 2016, 12:33 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/solarseven AT&T will bring its gigabit internet service to 11 more metro areas in the US, the company announced on Tuesday. According to a press release, the expansion is part of a newly-created umbrella brand called AT&T Fiber, which will explore new technologies for internet connectivity. "Customer demand for high-speed connectivity is exceeding even our high expectations. Today we're also introducing the AT&T Fiber umbrella brand, which lets us bring ultra-fast internet to even more residential and business customers through a mix of the latest network technologies," David Christopher, CMO of the AT&T Entertainment Group, said in the press release. Under the new AT&T Fiber brand, AT&T GigaPower will be rebranded as AT&T Internet 1000. Currently, AT&T offers fiber internet service in 29 US metro areas. The additional 11 will bring the total number to 40, but AT&T said in the press release that they are targeting deployment in 45 total metro areas by the end of 2016. They also said they are planning to hit at least 67 in total sometime in the future. SEE: Google's Fiber lottery: Predicting who's next and how Google picks winners To see what metro areas are available now, and which areas AT&T currently has underway, check out this map. In terms of the recent expansion, AT&T is targeting the following 11 areas: Florida: Gainesville and Panama City Georgia: Columbus Kentucky: Central Kentucky Louisiana: Lafayette Mississippi: Biloxi-Gulfport and Northeast Mississippi North Carolina: Wilmington Tennessee: Southeastern Tennessee and Knoxville Texas: Corpus Christi AT&T said in its press release that it had planned to be in 12.5 million total locations by mid-2019, but if development continues at its current rate, then those plans could be surpassed. AT&T also said that it has connected more than 1 million "incremental business customer locations" to fiber as well.

However, Verizon Fios claims coverage in only 12 US cities, and while Google Fiber had expanded rapidly for a while, it was recently reported that the company was cutting jobs amid poor adoption rates. However, there is another reason why AT&T is aggressively expanding its fiber network—it was ordered to do so by the government. When AT&T purchased DirecTV back in the summer of 2015, the FCC set requirements that AT&T had to build out a fiber network to provide high-speed internet connection to at least 12.5 million people within four years. The idea was that it would increase competition among internet providers and (assumedly) would make it easier for cord cutters in areas where AT&T and DirecTV would no longer be competing. Regardless of the motivations behind it, AT&T is on track to become the largest fiber internet provider in the US. And, if the market matures and adoption increases, AT&T will be in a strong position as one of the top providers in the country. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers AT&T will be expanding its fiber internet services into 11 more metro areas in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. AT&T is quickly growing past its biggest competitors, Verizon and Google, and could end up as the top provider for fiber internet. The reason AT&T is targeting so many regions is to fulfill requirement set by the FCC during its purchase of DirecTV in 2015.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel XL’s Geekbench performance scores not as impressive By R Padla - October 7, 2016 5 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We’re very much looking forward to reading reviews about the new Pixel and Pixel XL. These new phones from Google is the first pair of smartphones without the Nexus tag. Manufactured by HTC, the two Pixels are expected to impress the mobile industry. But right now, we don’t have reports and figures to show you except for the scores of a recent Geekbench performance test. The numbers of the Google Pixel XL for both single-core test and multi-core test hit 1648 and 4121, respectively. This may be an early benchmark and analysis but the numbers are disappointing because the Pixel XL is already equipped with a Snapdragon 821. It’s expected to perform better than the Snapdragon 820. The latter is found in most of the latest premium phones available in the market today like the Galaxy Note 7, Galaxy S7/S7 edge, LG G5, HTC 10, and OnePlus 3 among others. As for the Pixel XL, it’s the first-ever S821-powered smartphone to be released in the US. There’s that expectation of better performance but unfortunately, the Google Pixel XL with Snapdragon 821 didn’t show a significant improvement. Scores are still high though but close or similar to the Qualcomm S820-equipped phones. We’re not sure how different or better the Snapdragon 821 should be but we were at least expecting longer battery life, faster browsing, and the phone not heating up quickly. The scores aren’t always good indicators because calculations may differ every time. We’re still looking forward to more test, analyses, tear downs, and reviews before we can say if the Pixel series is worth our attention or not.

Read More . Many consumers don’t get their money back. Fortunately, you can get reimbursed for all manner of mishaps — even for out-of-warranty devices. However, refunds may require a credit card, documentation, and persistence. Let’s start with a hypothetical scenario: you purchased a device, and it breaks. What should you do? Your course of action depends on when you bought the device, whether you used a credit card, and what kind of credit card you own. Some cards can get even smashed or stolen items refunded. On top of that, almost all credit cards offer extended warranties that can get your money back well after the warranty ends. When Did the Device Break or Go Missing? Within 30 days of purchase? Most retailers take returns if the device breaks within 30 days (sometimes less). Between 31 and 90 days after purchase on a credit card? Those with lost, broken, or stolen devices may need to rely on a credit card company. Within the warranty period? If the device breaks inside of the manufacturer’s warranty period, return it to the manufacturer. The device broke a year after the warranty ended? File a claim with your credit card company. Did the Device Fail Within 30 Days? If your device fails within 30 days, return the device to the retailer. Most retailers offer no-hassle returns, provided the customer brings the product back within the return period. The return period differs depending on the retailer. Here are a few electronics dealers and their policies: Newegg’s return policy depends on the component. Computer motherboards aren’t returnable, for example. The standard return period is 30 days. Amazon’s return policy is a standard 30 days. eBay’s unofficial return policy is 30 days, although most fall somewhere around 14 days. Best Buy’s standard return policy offers a 15-day window, although they also handle warranty returns. Apple’s return policy is 14 days. Even worst-case scenarios are salvageable. If the seller refuses to provide a refund on defective merchandise, you can contact your credit card issuer and initiate a credit card chargeback. A chargeback forcibly refunds money from the fraudulent seller to the buyer. Ads by Google However, I caution against using chargebacks as the first line of defense against scams. It’s better used as a last resort. Credit card companies take chargebacks very seriously, and abuse can lead to legal trouble. However, if the device gets stolen or broken through misuse, the return period gets invalidated. Fortunately, if you used a particular type of credit card, there’s an additional degree of protection called purchase protection, which covers up to 90 days after the sale. The Device Breaks or Is Lost Within 90 Days The manufacturer’s warranty only covers defective devices — usually within a year from the day of purchase. This protection doesn’t extend to accidental damage or theft. Fortunately, a few credit cards include an insurance policy known as Purchase Protection or Purchase Assurance. The exact terminology depends on the credit group. Purchase protection gets buyers their money back in case of accident, theft, or acts of God. There are a lot of variations in how claims get processed but, in general, you need the following documentation: Original receipt (electronic copies also work); Original warranty card or documentation (sometimes required); The credit card used to make the purchase; Account statement showing the purchase; And a police report, if stolen. I tested Chase’s Purchase Protection, and the process is identical to filing an insurance claim. Card holders need to call their card provider and speak with its benefits division. The card holder must then request to activate Purchase Protection. At this point, filing a claim can be done either electronically or via snail mail. During this process, a claims inspector must validate your paperwork and documentation, which can take months. If successful, the credit company remits all, or part, of the money. Here’s the email that I received after filing the claim via telephone: I just printed and filled out the requisite paperwork, attached it to the form included with the email, and mailed it out. The Device Breaks Within the Warranty Period If the gadget breaks within the manufacturer’s warranty period, first contact the manufacturer. (We recommend using GetHuman.) However, sometimes the manufacturer doesn’t answer emails or calls. In this case, two courses of action can help get your money back: invoke the extended warranty or escalate the conflict. Use Your Credit Card’s Extended Warranty Credit companies — almost universally — bundle extended warranties with their cards. A credit card company’s extended warranty adds one to two years to the original manufacturer’s warranty. Replacement policies vary by credit group. For example, Cardhub’s analysis indicates that American Express provides — by a large margin — the best extended warranty service out of the four credit groups. You need the following documentation to invoke the card’s extended warranty: Original receipt (electronic copies aren’t accepted); Original warranty card or documentation; The credit card used to make the purchase; Account statement showing the purchase. The terms of the extended warranty vary by individual credit groups. For example, Visa Signature cards (but not all Visa cards) extend the warranty by a whopping two years. Both CardHub and Nerdwallet, on the other hand, regard American Express as the overall best credit group for extended warranties. Escalate the Conflict When a device breaks within the warranty period — and you aren’t responsible — contact the manufacturer. Unfortunately, that means dealing with customer service. Again, we recommend using the website GetHuman. Returning a defective device requires a return merchandise authorization (RMA). Getting an RMA requires some patience, for several reasons. First, dealing with customer support may entail escalation. If customer support cannot equitably resolve your case, you must speak with a higher support tier. For example, if a technician concludes that your laptop works fine, you must ask to speak with a supervisor. If the supervisor cannot resolve the issue, you must speak to the supervisor’s superior. Unfortunately, delinquent manufacturers won’t honor warranties. If you didn’t use a credit card to purchase the device, you might need to complain through social media Are You Getting The Most Out Of Your Customer Service Experience? Are You Getting The Most Out Of Your Customer Service Experience? Have you ever called customer service, only to end the call frustrated, disappointed and without resolution? Or perhaps there was a resolution, but it was unfavorable and certainly not worth the time you spent on... Read More . Here’s an example of a complaint lodged on Twitter: The battery on my phone is being super weird. Was just charged to 100%, two minutes later it’s at 94% @SamsungMobileUS — Kini (@kinilei1) September 28, 2016 Samsung responded immediately: @kinilei1 Hello and apologies for the delay. We saw your post and we’d like to help. How long have you been havin… https://t.co/Oi84Obxw9V — Samsung Support USA (@SamsungSupport) September 28, 2016 As you can see, social media gets results, and it gets them fast. Unfortunately, if your device fails outside the warranty period, contacting customer service may not help. The Device Fails After Two Years If the device fails outside of the warranty, your options narrow. While a credit card’s extended warranty can run up to two years past the manufacturer’s warranty, in most cases, two years spells the end of a potential refund.

What’s the Moral of the Story? I strongly recommend that consumers use a credit card to purchase high-value electronics.

Close share panel × There are three main issues the UK needs to address if it is going to build a technology company on the scale of Google, according to a group of entrepreneurs. For the BBC's recent Tech Talent week we asked why the UK can't build a company on the scale of Google. Media captionAlex Depledge chairs the Coalition for a Digital Economy (COADEC) Each day we did a video profile of someone with a stake in the UK tech economy, to get their perspective on the issue. Our guests were established technology entrepreneurs Alex Depledge and Herman Narula; aspiring start-up founders Ben Stanway and David Kramaley; and start-up mentor Stefano Tresca. Each person made his or her contribution separately. Nonetheless, three common ideas emerged for plotting a route to UK tech success. Big breakthrough role models Success breeds success. You knew this already. But had you considered this can be both psychological and practical? Ben Stanway, in his twenties, has just started his entrepreneurial journey with his app Moneybox, which is barely a month old in the App Store. It allows you simultaneously to track your personal finances and to invest. He admitted to craving psychological inspiration from entrepreneurial role models in the UK. Media captionNew founder Ben Stanway craves role models "This is a very important thing," he explained. The more role models there are, the better it is for the whole ecosystem. So it's great to see companies such as TransferWise and Deliveroo succeed globally." For Herman Narula, founder and chief executive of virtual reality company Improbable, these success stories also need to fire up the imagination. "We need to be comfortable with the idea of setting up a company to find something mind-blowingly important, like electric cars or space travel. We need a single, breakout success." Indeed UK entrepreneurs with "megalomaniac" ambitions are what we need, according to Stefano Tresca. He is in close contact with the start-up community, as co-founder of Level 39, an incubator initiative in London. American entrepreneurs have a natural desire to become the biggest company in the world, he said. "It's not that European entrepreneurs are lazy, but if you aim the bar low, it's very hard to build something big." "Europeans love to cash out and sell their company, live the good life, and that includes me," he admitted. Media captionStefano Tresca talks about ambition and investors in the UK However, success when it comes will bring very practical advantages to everyone, explained entrepreneur Alex Depledge. "We don't really have that many people in the UK or even Europe who have captained or been a part of an early stage company as it scales up rapidly." She sold her online business for booking domestic cleaners, Hassle, to a German company after three years for £24m. Looking back, she feels a shallow talent pool held back growth. "It's like the blind leading the blind." Digital Europe For Alex Depledge and fellow seasoned entrepreneur Herman Narula, the issue of Brexit weighed heavily on their minds. What they feared most was losing access to something that is still emerging: the European Digital Single Market. This is an initiative by the European Commission to harmonise rules for doing digital business in Europe. It was launched by Jean-Claude Juncker in May last year and covers everything from copyright and data protection to digital business regulation. "We need to make the Digital European Single Market for e-economy come true," said Herman Narula. "That would be amazing for companies trying to build successful platforms." Media captionHerman Narula shares his vision for success in the UK If the UK wants to match the US in building vast technology companies, said Alex Depledge, matching its consumer base by tapping into Europe makes sense. "Imagine this, the US has a domestic market of 300 million consumers. In the UK our market is 70 million. But put us in Europe and it's 500 million. But the cost of us doing business across Europe is so much greater than the cost within the US, where state to state their markets are quite harmonised. "Unfortunately, for me, the vote for Brexit has just set ourselves back at least four or five steps in that mission to create companies as big as Apple and Google." It remains to be seen during Brexit negotiations whether the UK can gain access to any benefits from this emerging Digital Single Market. Ambition please, investors... "Too many conservative investors in Europe is a problem," said Stefano Tresca, "because now it's a global fight. "If you don't have the money to fight the US competition, however good you are, you can lose." David Kramaley is on the sharp end of this phenomenon. The American start-up entrepreneur is trying to make it in the UK with his chess app, Chessable. "European investors treat [you] cautiously and really want to know when they are going to see a return on their investment, [whereas] American investors feel they are part of the team," he explained. Media captionDavid Kramaley on how UK and US investors differ "Tech start-ups will always be risky ventures," he pointed out. "So it's not about lending, it's about being part of it." Moneybox founder Ben Stanway was also struck by this. "In the US they are very interested in what countries you want to expand into next," he recalled. "But in the UK we've had questions on whether we need to grow the team quite so fast." US tech firms raised $39bn (£25bn) last year, while UK ones raised $3.6bn (£2.4bn). But the problem isn't just down to frigidity among investors. There are bigger forces at work, according to two of our contributors. "We don't have the sophistication in the financial markets," explained Alex Depledge. There is funding available for the early stages of growth, she explained, but this starts to dry up when you need sums like £10m or more, to take your company to the next level. A US tech company can realistically look to float on the stock market, which is why they grow as big as they can, pointed out Stefano Tresca. Hence in their early days Google refused an offer from Yahoo, and Facebook resisted the charms of Google. There is less appetite among UK stock-pickers for tech companies, so instead UK tech companies grow to a reasonable size and sell out to a tech giant in a private sale. Eventually, all these entrepreneurs hope, it won't be just the ideas and the talent that originate in the UK, but the finance too. You can follow business reporter Dougal Shaw on Twitter or Facebook.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Leak  ⋮  Mobile Verizon Leaks Google Pixel Phone’s Additional Information, Including New Color Models By Omar Sohail Posted 1 month ago 15Shares Share Tweet Submit There are a good 10 hours remaining for the official announcement from Google regarding its Pixel and Pixel XL, but Verizon has managed to spill some additional information about the two smartphones. This information will probably lead you to make into making a better decision when upgrading to a new Android handset in the foreseeable future. Verizon Leaks a New Color Model for the Google Pixel Phones, as Well as the Available Storage Capacities Thanks to Verizon, we now know that there are going to be a total of three color variants of the Pixel devices: Silver Black Blue One other feature that Verizon managed to leak about the handsets is something called ‘Google Magic’. It’s definitely a feature listed, but sadly, there is no description of what it will actually do. Hopefully, when one of the executives get up on stage and decide to showcase ‘Google Magic’ in front of our eyes, we will know more about what it can do. As for the strengthened security, that’s a feature that all pure-Android devices are known for. If you want the best security and software updates to be released for your device first, then you’d best be owning a Pixel smartphone, or a device with the brand name Nexus labelled on it. One other thing you should know is that you will have two storage options to choose from: 32 and 128GB of internal memory. Since these devices are not going to arrive with expandable storage, you should take your sweet time in deciding which one to get. If you’re going to keep your device for a significantly long period, then it’s highly recommended that you invest in the 128GB storage model. At times, even 32GB of internal memory might fall short, even for casual users, so make sure you have plenty of storage available at your disposal. Advertisement Disappointingly enough, there isn’t a 256GB storage model included, but that would be a bit overkill because 128GB is definitely the sweet spot for storage lovers. What Verizon didn’t cater to is the pricing and availability of these devices, but with only a few hours remaining, looks like we’ll get to know about these elusive details now, won’t we? If you want to know more about what’s going to be announced today, be sure to go through our Google’s October 4 event roundup so that you are brought up to speed.

This list delivers much of what the Note 7 promises — a big screen, a long-lasting battery and a top-notch camera — without the risks. (Photo Credit: YouTube) iPhone 7 Plus Picture 2 of 9 Unless you're a committed Android devotee, this 5.5-inch phone should be near the top of the list for anyone who uses their phone as their primary camera. The dual lens setup for the 12-MP rear camera on the 7 Plus gives you a true 2X optical zoom and a software update lets you take photos with stunning deep focus effects. Apple's improved the battery life on its bigger phone, with the iPhone 7 Plus lasting 10.5 hours, and the phone is water resistant, too. Galaxy S7 Edge Picture 3 of 9 At 5.5 inches, the screen on the Galaxy S7 Edge isn't as big as what you'd get with the Note 7, but you'd make few other compromises. You still get a curved display with a very useful Edge screen, and the S7 Edge is just as resistant to dust and water as the Note 7. And if the Note 7's cameras impressed you, they offer the same 12-megapixel rear and 5-MP front cameras Samsung debuted with the S7 Edge. You'd be getting our favorite camera phone and our top rated smartphone overall with the S7 Edge. LG V20 Picture 4 of 9 We've only had a chance to look at the camera on this 5.7-inch smartphone, but if you're looking for a phone that can keep pace with the best camera phones Samsung has to offer, LG's latest flagship is a good pick. Besides the dual rear camera that help with wide-angle shots, a trio of microphones on the V20 do an excellent job of picking up audio. It's defintely a top big-screen contender if you shoot a lot of video with your smartphone.  Moto Z Play Picture 5 of 9 You'll never have to worry about battery life with Motorola's 5.5-inch modular phone. The Z Play is our current long-lasting smartphone champ, coming up just shy of 14 hours in our battery testing. The modular design also lets you add on accessories to boost the Moto Z capabilities, including a projector and a speaker. You will be taking a step down from the Note 7's camera, especially in low light, though the Moto Z Play's 16-MP shooter is still pretty impressive for a $449 phone. OnePlus 3 Picture 6 of 9 Samsung charges a bank account-breaking $849 for the Note 7. You can get a high-performing phone for less than half that amount with the 5.5-inch OnePlus 3. The same Snapdragon 820 processor that powers the Note 7 also can be found in the OnePlus 3, but the latter phone includes 6GB of RAM, helping it outpace the Note 7 in our tests. The 16-MP camera on the OnePlus 3 can hold its own against the best camera phones Samsung has to offer, though the shooter on the OnePlus 3 is less reliable in low-light settings. ZTE ZMax Pro Picture 7 of 9 So you like big-screen phones? Well, here's a 6-inch phablet that dwarfs the Note 7. And price tag on ZTE's phone is just as extreme, but in the other direction — you can get it for $99 through MetroPCS. Power users, beware: The ZMax Pro turned in average results in our benchmarking tests, and its cameras are easily the most disappointing feature about this otherwise promising phablet. Blu Energy XL Picture 8 of 9 Like the ZMax Pro, Blu's Energy XL goes big on screen size with a 6-inch curved display. You'll also enjoy longer battery life with the Energy XL — more than 12 hours. And at $299, Blu's phablet costs considerably less than the Note 7. You're also making performance trade-offs with this phone compared to the Note 7, and its color accuracy issues will disappoint if you're used to the Note 7's superior shooter.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google launched the Pixel and Pixel XL as a Verizon exclusive in the U.S., though you can also buy the phones unlocked straight from the Google Store website and at Best Buy. While Verizon is the only U.S. carrier selling the devices in stores, it looks like that may change early next month. AT&T is allegedly set to start selling the Pixel and Pixel XL in the first week of November, according to Android Central editor Jerry Hildenbrand. He shared the news on Twitter, noting that multiple “trustworthy” sources have been telling him the same thing. However, Hildenbrand admits that he doesn’t have enough evidence to report the rumor as news. @HsnAlmaweri @androidcentral OK. Pixel and Pixel XL at AT&T the first week of November. — Jerry Hildenbrand (@gbhil) October 6, 2016 Getting the new Pixel phones into AT&T stores would be a huge win for Google, especially if it happens as soon as early November before the busy holiday shopping season kicks off. It could help boost sales and give more people a chance to try out new features like Google Assistant by simply walking into a local carrier store. The Pixel and Pixel XL are solid flagship phones, though Google’s new hardware strategy still has its flaws. We’ll let you know if and when Verizon loses the exclusive on the Pixel.

Andy Boxall Digital TrendsOctober 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Look out Apple, Samsung, and just about every other smartphone maker out there, because Google’s coming for you with the new Pixel smartphones. There are two, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and they run the very latest version of Android, look super, and have some exclusive features to make sure smartphone fans sit up and take notice. They come just a few weeks after Apple’s latest iPhone models went on sale. Like the Pixel there are two different types, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and they both look great, have some special features not seen on other iPhones, and as always with an Apple launch, made people sit up and take notice. Related: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 — which 5-inch flagship is right for you? Inevitably, if you’re about to buy a new phone, these two will be on your list. The Pixel naturally goes up against the iPhone 7, so which one should you buy? Each phone has its own positive and negative points, and we’ve given them an thorough examination to find out which deserves your money. Google Pixel iPhone 7 Size 138.3 × 67.1 × 7.1 mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 in) 138.3 x 6.71 x 7.1 mm (5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.87 ounces (138 grams) Screen 4.7-inch Retina HD LED-backlit widescreen 4.7-inch Retina HD LED backlit screen Resolution 1,080 × 1,920 pixels (441 ppi) 1,334 x 750 pixels (326 ppi) OS Android 7.1 iOS 10 Storage 32, 128GB 32, 128, 256GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 A 10 Fusion with 64-bit architecture, M10 motion coprocessor RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 7MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30 or 60fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30 or 60fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated Yes, IP67 rated Battery 2,770mAh 1,960mAh Ports USB Type-C Lightning Marketplace Google Store Apple App Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, Jet Black, gold, rose gold, silver Availability Verizon, Google Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile Price $650 $650 DT review Hands-on  3.5 out of 5 stars Performance Google PixelMore The Google Pixel is bang up to date with its processor. It uses the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which is a small but significant update to the Snapdragon 820, seen in most major flagship phones released during 2016. The 64-bit Snapdragon 821 has four cores and gets a 10 percent performance bump over the already speedy Snapdragon 820, a 5 percent increase in graphical capabilities, is more energy efficient, and can use Quick Charge 3.0 for even faster battery recharging. Apple doesn’t use a Snapdragon chip, and instead uses the A10 Fusion chip of its own design. Apparently it’s 40 percent faster than the A9, according to Apple, and it’s the first time the company has used a quad-core chip. Both chips utilize the multiple cores in a similar way, splitting the workload across them to reduce power consumption during easy tasks. The Snapdragon 821 is so new, we’ve not seen a phone with it inside to test out yet, so establishing any of our own benchmarks is impossible. Early benchmark results seen in Geekbench 4 return a multi-core score of 4,089. The iPhone 7 managed 5,600. Does that make the Pixel a slowcoach? No, and we’re wary of that unconfirmed benchmark, as the Galaxy S7 regularly scores over 5,000, and it uses a Snapdragon 820 chip. At this early stage, we can’t say either phone is faster than the other. However, we know the iPhone 7 is quick, and have no reason to think the Snapdragon 821 will be any different. Elsewhere, the Pixel comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and doesn’t have a MicroSD card slot, sadly. The iPhone 7 adds a 256GB option to the list, so if masses of storage are important to you (and you can stomach the extra cost), the Apple phone has a slight advantage here. Winner: Tie (pending further tests) Design iphone-7More Read More This is ultimately going to come down to personal preference, but there are a few things you should keep in mind as you size the two up. The Pixel is made of metal, glass, and plastic. The glass panel on the rear provides the antenna with room to breathe, while the plastic sections recall manufacturer HTC’s Desire range of phones. It’s thin at 7.1mm and light at 143 grams. For the iPhone 7, Apple has blended in the antenna breaks more than on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, decluttering the rear panel, but keeping the camera bump. Google has avoided this by slightly enlarging the body itself. The iPhone 7’s body is made from aluminum, is 7.1mm thick, and a little lighter than the Pixel at 138 grams. In our hands-on, the Pixel is described as being, “high-end, not too heavy, or fragile, even with the half-glass back.” Concerns over the screen bezel are also unfounded, with it appearing larger in pictures than in real life. The iPhone 7 is extremely comfortable to hold, with wonderfully curved sides, and corners that nestle in the palm nicely. Arguably, the Pixel looks a lot like an iPhone, but this doesn’t really bother us — both are great looking phones. Google gives you the choice of a white, black, or limited edition blue Pixel, and it’s the blue that really catches the eye. The iPhone 7’s jet black color is the elusive limited edition for showoffs, and it’s the regular matte black that’s the winner, as it neatly conceals the antenna lines for a smooth look. Google’s phones have never been stunners, while the iPhone 7 has a class that the Pixel can’t quite match, supreme in-hand comfort, and a real premium build, which along with its lighter body and wider choice of colors sees it edge out the Pixel here. Winner: iPhone 7 Battery and audio Google Pixel phoneMore Google has selected a 2,770mAh battery for the Pixel, complete with fast charging provided by the Snapdragon 821 and Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 feature. Plug it in using the USB Type-C cable and after 15 minutes it’ll be at 70 percent capacity. We’ve not used the phone for long enough to judge the overall use time on a daily basis. Inside the iPhone 7 is a 1,960mAh battery and in our review, we have seen 12 hours of solid use, and more than 40 percent left at the end of a day. There’s no fast charging though, and recharging the iPhone 7 will take longer than the Pixel. Neither phone has wireless charging as standard. The iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, and audio performance is vastly improved over the iPhone 6S while the Pixel has a single downward firing speaker. However, the Pixel retains a 3.5mm headphone socket, while Apple forces you to use headphones with a Lightning connector or Bluetooth. More battery capacity, faster charging, and a traditional headphone socket make the Pixel a clear winner. Winner: Google Pixel Display Apple iPhone 7 PlusMore Looking at the numbers, the Pixel should run away here. The 5-inch display is an AMOLED panel, therefore producing deep blacks and strong colors. It has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution and a 441ppi pixel density, is covered in protective 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4, and Google claims it has an excellent viewing angle with little decrease in brightness. Related: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The iPhone’s Retina HD LED-backlit screen measures 4.7-inches, has a 1,334 x 750 pixel resolution for a 326ppi pixel density, and also a 2.5D piece of glass over the front. Although it has a lower resolution, it does still look great, but the Pixel’s AMOLED screen and higher pixel count will automatically make pictures, webpages, and games look better. However, there is one thing in the iPhone 7’s favor, and that’s 3D Touch, Apple’s pressure sensitive system. Here, additional functionality can be accessed with a harder screen press, and it’s surprisingly helpful, especially with iOS 10 installed. The Pixel doesn’t have this feature. Despite this, it’s as much a software feature as it is a display feature, giving the Pixel the win. Winner: Google Pixel Camera Google Pixel phoneMore Let’s start with a spec shootout. The Pixel and the iPhone 7 both have 12-megapixel rear cameras. The Pixel has an f/2.0 aperture against the iPhone 7’s f/1.8 aperture, which should let in a little more light, plus it has a quad-LED flash rather than the Pixel’s dual-LED. However, while both have phase detection autofocus, laser autofocus only comes on the Pixel. Both have image stabilization, but only the iPhone uses traditional OIS, as the Pixel has a clever system that utilizes the phone’s gyroscope for smoothing out video. We’re big fans of the iPhone 7’s camera, although consider the iPhone 7 Plus to be the real winner, but have yet to really put the Pixel’s camera to the test. In our hands-on with the phone, we noted the speed with which it captured and processed photos, along with its low-light performance and cool HDR+ mode. The Pixel also has free, unlimited full resolution photo storage in the cloud through Google Photos, while you’ll have to pay for extra iCloud space or full-res Google Photos storage if you own an iPhone. Until we get our hands on the Pixel for a full review, we must turn to well-respected camera testers DxOMark, where the Pixel received an 89 rating, the highest of any smartphone yet. The iPhone 7 isn’t far behind with 86 though. It’s likely to be a tight contest between the iPhone 7 and the Pixel here, just like it is between the iPhone and the Galaxy S7, so we’re calling it a tie for now. Winner: Tie (Pending further tests) Durability Apple iPhone 7 PlusMore Unless these phones are securely wrapped up in a case, neither are going to come off well in the event of a nasty fall. Glass and aluminum bodies aren’t designed to withstand much shock. It’s also worth mentioning that if you choose the jet black iPhone 7 and don’t wrap it in a case, expect it to gather up some scratches and scuffs pretty quickly. Apple knows the special finish is delicate, and recommends the use of a case. Apple now edges ahead of the Pixel here, having made the iPhone meet IP67 standards of splash, water, and dust resistance. We’ve tested this out, and the iPhone happily continues working after taking a bath, something the Pixel is unlikely to do even with its basic IP53 protection. Accidents happen, and if they involve the wet stuff, you’ll be glad it was the iPhone and not the Pixel underwater. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Software Google PixelMore If design was a difficult category to judge, due to personal preference playing a considerable role, software is also subjective. Unlike pitting a phone like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 against the Pixel, Apple is prompt and regular with its software updates, which matches how Google will react with its new Pixel devices. The Pixel comes with Android 7.1 installed, the very latest version of the operating system, which can’t (and won’t) be found in this form anywhere else. The Apple iPhone has iOS 10. The two are very different, yet also quite alike. There are icons to tap, a virtual assistant to help — Assistant on the Pixel and Siri on the iPhone — and special messaging apps for both. On the Pixel, it’s Duo for video calls and Allo for chats, while on the iPhone there’s FaceTime and iMessage. Downsides of Google’s operating system don’t really apply here. It’s going to get regular updates, there’s no messy user interface over the top, and you’re assured of the latest version for at least a few years yet. Apple treats the iPhone in the same way. There’s little to choose between them when it comes to app stores either, with both being equally well stocked with apps, books, movies, and more. Winner: Tie Pricing and availability Apple iPhone 7More Wallets at the ready? They better be, because you’re going to have to open them pretty wide to get either one of these phones. Unlocked, without a contract, the Pixel will cost you $650 for the 32GB model or $750 for the 128GB, and it can be purchased directly through the Google Play Store. The iPhone 7 also costs $650 for the 32GB, $750 for the 128GB, and then $850 for the 256GB model. It can be bought through the Apple Store, either online or in a retail store. Contract prices vary for the iPhone, but it’s available with each major carrier in the U.S., while the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive. This hurts the Pixel here. We don’t like being forced onto one carrier and many people buy their phones in stores. However, there is good news for the Pixel: You can buy it unlocked from Google and get the same month-to-month financing you get with the iPhone at carriers. We’d suggest not buying either phone locked to a network, or fixed into a contract, anyway. There are financing options available for both the Pixel and the iPhone 7 through Google and Apple respectively too. However, be aware if you choose an iPhone on AT&T or Sprint with financing through Apple, it’ll be locked to that network. International buyers will also find it easier to buy an iPhone 7, with 25 countries on the list at launch, and more than 30 having been added since then. Others are coming in October. Google is only selling the Pixel in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany at the moment. Wider availability, more carrier options, and equal pricing sees the iPhone take this category. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Overall winner: iPhone 7 (for now) It’s three category wins for the iPhone 7, and two for the Pixel, with three overall ties. However, two of those sections will likely have a different result when we’ve played with the Pixel for a longer amount of time, so there’s still everything to play for. It’s interesting to see where the iPhone 7 beats the Google Pixel, particularly because durability and price have long been problem areas for Apple, and winners for Android phones. Apple has turned that around with the iPhone 7. The Pixel has it beaten when it comes to display, battery, and the presence of a 3.5mm headphone socket. Right now, because you can buy it in more places, with fewer restrictions, and it won’t stop working if it gets wet, the iPhone 7 has to take the win. Don’t dismiss the Pixel yet though, we’ve yet to test out two areas where it could very easily fight back and take the win. Check back soon.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google Hangouts to be replaced by Duo in the Google Apps package for Android Christian de Looper Digital TrendsOctober 7, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google has updated Hangouts to version 14.0, bringing a number of new features to the app. The most notable change? Android 7.1 app shortcuts. The app shortcuts available on Hangouts include "Chat," "Video call," and "Voice call."More It looks like Google is moving its focus away from Hangouts and toward other solutions. Although not unexpected, the company today started sending emails to Mobile Service partners saying that Hangouts would be removed from the core Android apps package. What that means is that hardware manufacturers will no longer have to bundle Hangout with their new hardware, a change that will take effect starting on December 1, according to a report from Android Police. Related: Hangouts for Android version 11 removes threaded SMS messaging So what’s replacing Hangouts? Google Duo, it seems. Duo is Google’s new video chatting app, which offers a number of new features, such as “knock knock,” which allows the person being called to see a feed of the person calling them before they answer the call. It’s important to note that this doesn’t mean that Hangouts is dead. It just means that if you want to continue using it on your Android device, you’ll need to head to the Play Store and download it yourself rather than having it preinstalled on any new Android device you buy. This also doesn’t mean that manufacturers can’t bundle Hangouts with their phones — although it’s likely that they won’t as a way to push their own apps and services. It is somewhat interesting that it’s Duo replacing Hangouts and not Allo, but it does highlight that Google has a big focus on video messaging. As you might remember, Hangouts had video messaging functionality as well. It’s also interesting that Allo isn’t already mandatory as an app on Android, especially given the fact that Allo has an uphill battle ahead of it in competing with services like Facebook Messenger, Kik, WhatsApp, and so on. Google’s message to partners notes that the company will continue to support Hangouts for the foreseeable future, which makes sense. It seems as though Hangouts is being pivoted to a business messaging platform, so we’ll continue to see improvements made to the app over time.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel phone carrier details and pricing review Chris Burns - Oct 7, 2016 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Today we’re having a very brief and simple look at the various ways in which a person might purchase and utilize a Google Pixel or Google Pixel XL smartphone. There aren’t a whole lot of options, at first glance – Verizon even seems to be pushing the idea that they will be the sole carrier option for the smartphone, the only place a person will be able to buy from! But they’re not. And it’s not. Google has made this decision very simple for people that check news and review sources like SlashGear before they buy. Point 1: do not buy directly from Verizon [UPDATE: maybe do!] Even if I planned on purchasing a Pixel or Pixel XL to use with my Verizon SIM card, I would not purchase it directly from Verizon. The one reason for this is, while I don’t assume I’ll get updates forever, I still want them for as long as possible, and as quick as possible. • Google handles and delivers Android security patches • Google delivers OS updates, but only at first… Google delivers OS updates to Verizon. Verizon then takes those updates and puts the update through a certification process, which – as we know – can take a while. Or perhaps Verizon has streamlined their process. You never know.* But why take the chance? *We do know now – or at least Verizon has made a promise. Updates at the same time regardless of if we purchased the device with Verizon or Google. How about that? Google’s goal in working with Verizon was and is to have it available in the United States’ topmost used and visited wireless smart device carrier store. Some people, believe it or not, simply go to their wireless carrier and buy a new phone when they need one, no research done, completely dependent on the store employees themselves. That’s a real thing. That really happens. As such, Google needs the shelf space Verizon can provide, as well as the pocketbooks that are only opened in Verizon stores nationwide. Point 2: Google has the same device The Google Store online has the exact same device as Verizon. Not just a slightly different bit of hardware with different branding. Literally the same hardware. This is made possible by Qualcomm, which delivers technology which allows any of the carriers in the USA (and most/all outside the USA) to pop in a SIM card and go. The only differences between the Verizon-sold and Google-sold versions of the device are the following: • Verizon has a trade-in program where my old phone could be worth up to $300. Or I could sell that phone basically anywhere else and more than likely get more than Verizon could give me. • Neither version has preloaded apps from Verizon. There are three apps from Verizon which will automatically install themselves from the Google Play app store once a device is activated with a Verizon SIM card, but they’ll all immediately be able to be uninstalled, easy peasy. • The Verizon-sold Pixel has ONE software difference right out the gate – its bootloader is encrypted. If I didn’t ever want to modify the software of the Pixel at a ROM-level, I wouldn’t worry about this. But I’d like the option, especially since… Point 3: Both Google and Verizon’s Pixel cost the same If I buy the Pixel from Google it’ll be $650 or $27 a month. It’s the same pricing from Verizon*, and both stores have free shipping. *Except Verizon adds a $20 activation fee. Google and Verizon also have their own “protection plans”. Google’s Protection Plan costs either $79 or $99 for 2-years of coverage and Verizon’s Protection Plan costs $11 a month (that’s $264 for two years). Point 4: Freebie VR! Both the Verizon-sold and the Google-sold Pixel and Pixel XL include a free Daydream View VR headset. Google is really pushing the Daydream with this release – really, really pushing it hard. Sound like a good deal? Find the Pixel in the Google Store online and use the SIM card you already have. Even if it’s from Verizon. Or AT&T, T-Mobile USA, or anyone else.

 More software engineers over age 40 may join a lawsuit against Google Julie Bort Oct. 7, 2016, 3:53 PM 35,324 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty / Justin Sullivan Google suffered a setback in an age discrimination suit this week. A judge ruled that other software engineers over age 40 who interviewed with the company but didn't get hired can step forward and join the lawsuit. The suit was brought by two job applicants, both over the age of 40, who interviewed but weren't offered jobs. Specifically, the judge has approved turning the suit into a "collective action" meaning that people who "interviewed in person with Google for a software engineer, site reliability engineer, or systems engineer position when they were 40 years old or older, and received notice on or after August 28, 2014, that they were refused employment, will have an opportunity to join in the collective action against Google," the ruling says.  While this isn't good news for Google, the ruling was strictly focused on whether the suit could be broadened to include more people. It doesn't meant that Google will ultimately lose the case. Google says it's fighting the suit. A spokesperson told us, "We believe the allegations here are without merit and we will continue to defend our position vigorously. We have strong policies against discrimination on any unlawful basis, including age." Interestingly, the judge is particularly not buying that "policies" defense from Google, writing in the ruling:  "Having such a policy does not necessarily shield a company from a discrimination suit, particularly in light of the evidence and allegations presented here ... today, most, if not all, companies are well versed in anti-discrimination and make great efforts to ensure their written policies comply with anti-discrimination law." In terms of allegations, one of the plaintiffs alleged that a Google recruiter told her she needed to puts the dates of her graduation on her resume so interviewers could determine her age. That same plaintiff argued that she had found seven others who say they had similar experiences at Google. She also presented evidence to the court that the median age of Google's workforce is 29 while the median age in the US for programmers is 42.8 years old. How old are Google employees? Google has about 61,000 employees and we asked Google if the company has publicly released statistics on its median age. Age is not included with the company's published diversity report, which discusses sex and race. Google didn't respond. Father of the Internet and Google employee Vint Cerf is one example of the Google's "Greyglers" group Google However, we do know that Google has a diversity club on campus called "Greyglers" which is for Googler employees over 40. The company describes it as a group for "company elders" that helps the company with "promoting age diversity awareness." The company was sued way back in 2004 for age discrimination and, after winding through the appeals system, the case was ultimately settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Still, just allowing people who went on job interviews but didn't get a job to join a suit is a startling turn of events.  Some folks on Hacker News, a site where programmers discuss news items of interest to them, worry that instead of solving the tech industry's age discrimination problem, it will make it worse. One wrote:  "Fallout from this: Companies will go to great lengths to avoid contact with people who submit resumes that imply they are old. No phone screens, no responses. It's going to be wintertime for folks in their late 30s now." SEE ALSO: Apple mysteriously banned a popular app from its App store ... and a lot of t imply they are old.

The secret scanning tool rocked the tech world and that of privacy and anti-surveillance activists this week, shocked by how broad the request was, and the fact that it had kept under wraps. Until Reuters reported its existence this week, the tool remained a secret not just to the public, but also to most people at Yahoo, including the security team, which caught it and thought it was a sophisticated and dangerous piece of malware installed by hackers, as reported by Motherboard on Friday. Read more: A Frustrating Conversation About Privacy With Google's New Allo Chatbot In an age where the FBI asked Apple to unlock the iPhone of a dead terrorist, and countless top secret documents revealed the vast surveillance powers of the NSA, asking Yahoo to use a scanning tool that former employees defined as a “buggy” and a “poorly designed” “backdoor” or “rootkit,” was an unusual request as it wasn’t targeted—Yahoo was essentially looking through the whole haystack looking for a few needles—and the company apparently didn’t fight back. But such a request is a perfect example of how the rise of encryption technologies have changed the face of government surveillance. Before large tech companies such as Google and Yahoo turned on default encryption across their services, including email—in the process protecting their customers data as it travelled from their computers to the company’s servers, as well as when the data travelled through the internet—the NSA could’ve gone through users’ data without having to knock on Yahoo’s door. “Five years ago the government would’ve just done this by spying on international telecommunications traffic.” “Five years ago the government would’ve just done this by spying on international telecommunications traffic,” Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, told Motherboard. As revealed by documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the NSA and its British partner GCHQ have taps on the internet backbone infrastructure, and used to collect data directly from what they called “upstream” provides, none other than large ISPs. Before the Snowden revelations, when companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo, and other email providers didn’t use encryption, all these emails were travelling in the clear over the internet, and were collected by spy agencies. An illustration of how email travels across the internet, without STARTTLS. (Image: Riseup.net) Especially in the aftermath of the Snowden leaks, companies started adopting HTTPS, which encrypts connections between users and the server, and STARTTLS, which encrypts emails as they travel through the internet between providers. In 2014, Google reported that, for the prior year, only 33 percent of emails between Gmail and other providers were encrypted. The number rose to 58 percent in 2014, when major providers like Yahoo and Microsoft also adopted STARTTLS. Now, it’s almost pervasive, at more than 80 percent. An illustration of how email travels across the internet, with STARTTLS. (Image: Riseup.net) “Every time a provider turns on STARTTLS the NSA loses access to more and more email,” Soghoian told me. “NSA has lost a good percentage of its visibility into international email traffic without the help of tech companies.” Without the ability to just ingest emails travelling across the internet and looking through their content, the NSA has to ask the Yahoos, Googles and Microsofts of the world to do that for them now. In a way, this is the same issue the FBI and police are encountering when trying to break into iPhones, or intercepting end-to-end encrypted messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp. The data is now encrypted, and without some help hacking in, there’s no way in.

Google launches Android Pay at 5,000 Hong Kong locations 20 Oct 2016 Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with US$3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple. Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign”. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. The battle for smartphone supremacy: Google unveils new Pixel phone and VR headset to take on Apple and Amazon Wireless carrier Verizon Communications, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. “When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you,” he said. “But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 3 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 Elon Musk’s surprise unveiling of Tesla’s ‘solar roof’ Shared 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 3 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 China’s giant FAST radio telescope to join hunt for extraterrestrial intelligence Commented 1 Beijing confirms it will interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy 2 Oath-row intervention reflects Beijing’s distrust of Hong Kong judges, lawyers say 3 Hong Kong charities, unions and political organisations refuse to ‘say no to shark’s fin’ 4 Taiwan calls on Beijing to reopen dialogue to pave way for peace deal 5 How did China’s Xi Jinping secure ‘core’ status in just four years?

Here Are 9 Other Products They Straight Up Ditched By Stephen Clark  |  October 7, 2016  |  2:30pm Tech Lists google Share Tweet Text This week Google has commandeered all the headlines in the tech world with its announcement of not just two new smartphones, but also a whole bevy of other devices along with it. While there’s plenty of reasons to be excited for the new Pixel phone, Google is quietly killing the Nexus phone program. The hardware in Nexus phones and tablets have always been based on a major manufacturer’s flagship device, which doesn’t make much sense under Google’s new unified Hardware Division. Adapting third party manufacturer hardware to create a reference spec may return someday, but it will probably not be given the Nexus name. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. The truth is when you have as much money as Google, you can afford to bet on longshots. For every wildly successful product like Gmail, there’s a Buzz or Wave. In some ways, there’s something refreshing about Google’s willingness to invest in ideas and give them up when they actually don’t make sense anymore. What happened to Google’s longshot hardware ideas? We take a look through the hardware and concepts that Google has abandoned over the years. 1. Nexus Q The Nexus Q was announced at the Google I/O Developers Conference in 2012. It impressed many with a wealth of input formats, high-quality audio output, and network connectivity. Some were given away at first, but for $299 customers expected more when compared to the $99 Apple TV. It was discontinued before launching and the niche was filled a year later by the more capable Chromecast at nearly one-tenth the price. 2. Nexus Player Google TV was built upon Android 3.2 Honeycomb, but never caught on. When they relaunched the effort as Android TV built on 6.0 Marshmallow, Google released reference hardware in the Nexus Player to promote the experience. At only $99, Google was now in direct competition with the Apple TV. It featured voice search and a more open architecture for app development. Less than two years later Google discontinued it and underwhelming sales may have been to blame. 3. Low Cost Tablets Google released announced the Nexus 7 tablet for only $199 packaged with free content and a $25 credit on the Google Play store. They followed it up with the Nexus 4, a phone which matched flagship specs but cost as little as $299. Both devices were less than half that of flagship devices from Apple or the other Android manufacturers. While we did eventually get the Nexus 5, we never got our update to the Nexus 7. There was a hardware update to the Nexus 7 but third party suppliers didn’t like Google undercutting them. 4. Play Edition Phones Back in 2013, Android had a serious fragmentation problem. Every major manufacturer had their own custom tweaks to the OS making an inconsistent experience for both users and developers. Along comes the Play Edition series. Google took the flagship smartphones from Samsung, HTC, Sony and Motorola (and a tablet from LG) and built the same basic Android experience on each that you get from the Nexus devices. They still were sold at premium prices so sales paled in comparison to the Nexus 4. Interest by the manufacturers quickly waned and the program was cut the next year. 5. Google Wallet Card Many Android smartphones have NFC chips for secure purchases, but they are by no means in all of them. When Google Wallet was launched in 2011 they also released a debit card letting you access your account wherever you could use plastic. Google eliminated support for the debit card in July of this year to focus on their rising competition, namely Apple Pay. 6. Google Search Appliance Put the power of Google on your internal corporate network. Just one box can give you Google-like access to up to 30 million documents. Including features we love like autocomplete and user profiles, and a catalog of up to 20 languages and hundreds of file formats. Support is destined to end by 2018 with no new hardware planned. Instead, Google is pushing towards cloud-based search making many system administrators uneasy. 7. Google Glass In what looked like an attempt to jump ahead several generations in personal computing, Google released a heads-up display that floats just in front of the user’s eyeball. Featuring a camera, microphone, and internet-connectivity, it was the general public’s worst privacy nightmare. The conspicuous design of the headware meant “Glassholes” could be easily spotted. It became clear the world wasn’t ready for Glass, but the project earned Google a wealth of patents. It still exists as a B2B solution, but is no longer available in the public marketplace. 8. Project Ara An ambitious project was intended as part of Google’s effort to get low-cost phones into developing markets. The plan was to sell a framework where cell phone components like processor, GPS, camera, screen and more could be swapped out. Each can be removed and upgraded without having to replace the whole phone. By the start of 2016 the project was modified to force certain core components into the non-upgradable framework. By September of the same year the project was shelved altogether. 9. Google Talking Shoes Technically more of an experiment than a product destined for market. Google played with interactive designers YesYesNo to give shoes motion sensors, internet-connectivity, and… a personality? The idea was to show what’s possible by giving technology some character. How would we interact differently if we felt judged by our footwear? Like a concept car, the technology may someday become a part of our lives but this shoe won’t be in stores any time soon.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently. But, maybe it doesn’t work super-great just yet. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Watch Google’s presentation from Tuesday, and read our roundup of everything that was announced.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead.

We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants. David’s recommendation this week is Poisonfeather by Matthew Fitzsimmons. Michael recommends Amanda yerba mate.

For now, some of us still need powerful PCs. This week, we got to see that Microsoft and Apple are still intent on wowing our socks off when it comes to hardware for developers and creative professionals. With the new Surface Studio from Microsoft and the redesigned MacBook Pro from Apple, we’ve got some great options. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Surface Studio looks hot. So does the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Also see David’s hands-on report. Margaret Rhodes has some additional thoughts on the Touch Bar as well. There’s also a new Surface Book from Microsoft. David’s recommendation this week is Lessons From the Screenplay. Michael’s is the Jaybird X3 sweat-proof wireless earphones.

The Pixel maybe just tipped the scales, and it did so right at the moment we’re getting ready to move on to something else. With so many voice-controlled, non-smartphone devices in our homes, it sure feels like we’re at a flux point. Also, the Google Assistant, which lives in the Pixel, is so so powerful, and we’re headed for more of that. Michael and David (who is back from Bogota) discuss the changes in the personal tech landscape. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David’s review of the Google Pixel. A gallery of the full-size images he shot with the phone in Colombia. Tim Moynihan’s story about the Pixel’s advanced camera technology.

We bring in an expert, WIRED’s own Peter Rubin, to chart all of it. Peter manages WIRED’s culture and entertainment coverage and co-hosts The Monitor, our culture podcast. Peter is also well-steeped in face computers: he’s written stellar stories about Oculus and he’s been testing and ranking each new VR system as it’s released. With David out this week, Michael and Peter talk about PSVR, Google Daydream View, and the future of “untethered” real-deal VR. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Read Peter’s review of the Sony PlayStation VR headset and his report from last week’s Oculus Connect. Also, Chris Kohler writes about rhythm games and short-play games in VR. David Pierce has the details on Google’s phone-based Daydream View.

What we watch, what we watch it on, and what we do while we watch it. Not only is the technology of TV changing, but the content is morphing in a way that alters what we think of as “television.” Is a YouTube video TV? Sure, right. What about a Snapchat story, or a local city council meeting on Twitter? Yes—why not. The hosts discuss these changes in light of YouTube’s new app, Twitter’s new strategy, Snap’s new hardware, and Roku’s new future-proofed players. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David Pierce’s story on YouTube Go. The video from Vox about “the package” in Cuba. Brian Barrett on Snap Specs, and the WSJ feature that dropped suddenly. David also wrote about football on Twitter. Tim Moynihan’s rundown of the new boxes from Roku. David on Alto, the new email app from AOL. Easy, on Netflix.

Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library: For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Build settings To disable building the sandbox completely build with this in your mozconfig: ac_add_options --disable-sandbox To disable just the content sandbox parts: ac_add_options --disable-content-sandbox Environment variables Disable content process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX Disable media plugin sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_GMP_SANDBOX Disable NPAPI process sandbox MOZ_DISABLE_NPAPI_SANDBOX Allow weaker than default sandbox level MOZ_ALLOW_WEAKER_SANDBOX Enable sandbox logging MOZ_WIN_SANDBOX_LOGGING Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Overview Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Environment variables Enable sandbox logging MOZ_SANDBOX_VERBOSE Bug Lists Milestones Windows Content Process sbwc1 Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release. sbwc2 Roll out level 2 sandbox policy to release.

But privilege escalation via kernel vulnerabilities is relatively common, so we also use the seccomp-bpf system call filter to reduce the attack surface that a compromised content process can directly access.

The app will become part of GMS on December 1 and will replace Hangouts, will will become an optional GMS install. What this means is that, starting on December 1, manufacturers that want to install Google apps like Gmail and Google on their Android devices will also have to install Duo. This news shows that Google is really pushing Duo, hoping to make it the go-to video calling app for Android users. Making the app a required part of the GMS package will put Duo front and center on new Android phones, exposing it to millions of people that may not normally have known about it.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme No one should buy a Pixel smartphone from Verizon No one should buy a Pixel smartphone from Verizon By Joel Hruska on October 7, 2016 at 3:04 pm Comment Verizon is the major carrier partner for Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL. But that doesn’t mean it’s your only option for getting a device. Google will also sell Pixels directly from its own storefront — and if you care at all about system updates, unlocked bootloaders, or avoiding crapware, then the Google version of the device is the only one to buy. Granted, Verizon’s predatory business practices and relentless assault on customer privacy make it difficult for us to recommend buying anything from the company, but that’s something of a separate issue. First, here’s what Google has said on the topic. In an email to 9to5Google, the company writes: Monthly security updates will come from Google (for all models), and system updates will be managed by Verizon for Verizon models, and Google for unlocked models bought from Google Store. Verizon’s device has a locked bootloader, and comes with three pre-installed applications you don’t need — My Verizon, Go90 (a mobile TV app), and Verizon Messaging. The split between security updates and system updates means that while Google will guarantee you get your security updates, you won’t get newer versions of Android except on Verizon’s timeline — which basically means you won’t get new versions of Android until months later, if ever. Just because Google is handling security updates doesn’t mean those updates will continue to flow to older devices, mind you — over the past few years we’ve seen Google refuse to patch older versions of Android, even when failing to do so left hundreds of millions of devices vulnerable to known attacks. Regardless, if you plan to buy a Pixel and use it for more than 18 to 24 months, you should buy it from Google — that way you’ve got the best chance of getting both security and operating system updates in the future. Repeated studies have shown Apple does a better job than Google and the associated carriers do of keeping devices maintained. But Google Nexus products have typically been the best-supported over the long term of all Android devices. The Pixel is being advertised as a Verizon exclusive, but ignore that — the phone is actually widely available from major stores and outlets. Best Buy, Amazon, Target, and Google’s Project Fi all advertise the hardware, and the Pixel has been explicitly guaranteed to work on any US carrier. It’s not a Verizon-specific product, no matter what some of the ad copy says. So do yourself a favor and buy the unlocked Pixel, not the inferior Verizon-specific model.

Follow TechnoBuffalo In case you needed a reminder as to why an autonomous future is necessary and important, look no further than this report filed by Google. The search giant on Thursday released a report revealing one its self-driving cars was involved in an accident that sent the operator to the hospital. After a brief investigation, it was discovered the driver of a commercial van was found to be at fault after running a red light and t-boning Google’s self-driving car. According to Google, the autonomous vehicle noticed the van barreling toward it and slammed on the brakes, but not in time to avoid a collision. It’s unclear what caused the van to run the red light but it’s not far-fetched to think the driver may have been distracted. Whatever the cause, it underlines why autonomous technology could be a positive change for our roadways. Of course, autonomous technology isn’t without its faults. Earlier this year, one of Google’s self-driving cars caused an accident by changing lanes into a bus. That accident resulted in no major injuries. Meanwhile, a driver using Tesla’s prototype self-driving software was killed after he and the technology failed to avoid a truck that had turned into his path. Self-driving technology still needs a lot of work before it makes a significant impact on our daily lives. Until that happens, it’s clear that human drivers are susceptible to mistakes, which is why working toward an autonomous future is so important.

Sick and tired of searching for this post? I don’t blame you. You can receive it in your inbox on Saturdays if that’s more your style. 1. Google held its annual press event where it announced a ton of new hardware, some of which people cared about, some of which people did not care about. Most buzzed about may have been Google’s new Pixel phone with flagship-level specs and the launch of the Google Home device. Google also announced its Google Assistant AI platform, the Chromecast Ultra, Google Wifi and a new very cozy-looking VR headset. Here’s a quicker recap of the highlights, but you can find full coverage here too. 2. Google wasn’t the only big tech company to hold an event this week. Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at the Oculus Developers conference to show off a taste of Facebook’s mobile VR future. He introduced a new prototype standalone headset with positional tracking, and did a cool demo of augmented social VR with facial expressions. 3. Reports said that Snap Inc., the now-parent company of Snapchat, is working on an IPO for as early as March 2017 that would value the company at $25 billion or higher. 4. Samsung acquired Viv, an AI assistant system co-founded by the creator of Siri. Viv will continue to operate as an independent company and will provide services to Samsung platforms. 5. Amazon made a big change to some of its guidelines. The company banned incentivized reviews, in an effort to make its review and rating system fairer and more in favor of the shopper. Now, Amazon – not the seller or vendor – will be the party to identify trusted reviewers, and will have a number of controls in place in order to keep bias out of the review process. 6. Facebook launched two new services. Marketplace is like a friendlier Craigslist, which lets you search for, buy and sell items. Facebook also launched its standalone Events discovery and calendar app which lets you browse and search for fun things to do in your area. 7. Trouble may be afoot at Pinterest. Last year, the search and inspiration site was projecting around $169 million in revenue for 2015. However, reports are saying that Pinterest generated only about $100 million in revenue last year. Here’s what we think might be going on. 8. Apple lost a patent retrial to patent troll notorious litigator VirtnetX regarding patents in iMessage and FaceTime services. Apple has been ordered to pay $302.4 million.  9. Meerkat, the pioneering live stream social app whose popularity was quickly eclipsed by Twitter’s Periscope, is officially no longer with us. But the company itself carries on: they’re now focusing on Houseparty, a group video chat app they’ve been building in secrecy for months. 10. Facebook launched “Messenger Day,” a feature that lets people share illustrated, filter-enhanced photos and videos that have a 24-hour lifecycle, in Poland. Sound familiar? Facebook could be using Messenger to copy Snapchat in areas where Snapchat is not yet popular. 11. Salesforce bought Krux, a traffic tracking company, for $340 million in cash plus stock. 12. Sony’s PlayStation VR is set to launch on October 13, but we got our hands on it early for a review. It may not push every technical benchmark, it’s the most accessible piece of VR hardware and is going to change the industry for good. 13. The mobile market is no longer vibrant and varied. The mobile industry has become standardized and boring. This is your weekend thought piece.  0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Snapchat Starts Selling Spectacles | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories I refuse to review Snapchat Spectacles — but I’m glad to have my hands back 12 hours ago | Matthew Panzarino Facebook wants to make you secure no matter how hard you make it 15 hours ago | Ron Miller Driving the Midwest 15 hours ago | John Biggs Nintendowned: Amazon sells out of the NES Classic Edition in (null) seconds yesterday | Devin Coldewey, Contributor Latest From TechCrunch Secret is coming back 3 hours ago | Sarah Buhr Facebook needs accountability to win back advertisers’ trust 3 hours ago | James G.

The firm confirmed the Spring Street location, close to Apple's own Soho store, will open to the public on the 20th October to show off the firm's newly announced range of products, which include phones and its smart speaker Google Home. However, a source said it would not sell items - but simply let the public try them out before ordering online or in traditional stores. Scroll down for video  At a special event in San Francisco earlier the firm is unveiling a raft of new products - even though most of them have already leaked online. They include two new phones, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL WHAT GOOGLE UNVEILED  Pixel and Pixel XL handsets in 5 and 5.5inch screen sizes Google Home $129 smart speaker Google Daydream $79 VR headset that uses a phone as its screen $129 Google wifi router which can boost speeds if several are installed through a home   $49 Chromecast Ultra TV streaming dongle The search giant showed off a plethora of products from phones to TV dongles and even a new home router to boost wifi speeds earlier this week - and said AI was key to all of them.  It says it hopes to use AI to create 'a personal Google for each and every user'.  The range include two new phones, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL.  The new 'Pixel' smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple. Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Computers could be to blame for the pound's 'flash crash':...

Share this article Share While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker.  It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. The firm revealed the location of the store online 'This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,' said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a 'very significant marketing campaign'. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games.  Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple.  The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. 'When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you,' he said. 'But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice.' Google said the new products had one thing in common - AI.  'We're at a seminal moment in computing,' said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google.  'We are evolving from a mobile first to an AI first world. The new handset range includes two new phones, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Both have Google's new smart assistant built in. 'Computing will be everywhere, people will be able to interact seamlessly, and above all it will be intelligent.'  Pichai said a smart assistant was key to Google's plans. 'Our goal is to build a personal Google for each and every user.'  Pichai said its image recognition system was now 93.9% accurate. He also hailed advances in the firm's machine translation systems, which Pichai said was now approaching human levels for Chinese to English. Google has also boosted its text to speech system, making it more natural.  'This is key to our vision of building a Google for each user.'  Brian Rakowski of Google said the phone was 'designed inside and out to be smart' and will be avialble in three colours. Sabrina Ellis, Google director of product management, talks about the new Google Pixel phone during the event. The new phones represent a big, new push by Google to sell its own consumer devices, instead of largely just supplying software for other manufacturers. 'Today is about getting the assistant in the hands of our user. 'We are bringing it into the context of the phone, and the home.' Analysts say the handsets could hurt Samsung. 'Pixel looks more and more the phone that will turn Android lovers into Google lovers - Samsung will hurt the most,' said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. GOOGLE PIXEL SPECS  The Pixel runs on a Snapdragon 821 2.15GHz processor. The handsets come in 32GB or 128GB models, with microSD card slots enabling an additional 256GB of storage. The handset will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip They have 12.3 and 8-megapixel cameras and a full HD AMOLED screen with Gorilla Glass protection. Fast charging gives 7 hours of use in 15 minutes  Included is Google's AI assistant, Allo for messaging and Duo for video calls. Free online storage for pictures and video  Will be available in US on Verizon and in an unlocked version from $649.  The new handset range includes two new phones, a Pixel and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL. Rick Osterloch, the head of Google's newly formed hardware division, revealed the new products.  'We believe the next big thing will be at the intersection of hardware and software.' Osterloch also took aim at Apple, saying the phone has 'no unsightly phone bump'. Brian Rakowski of Google said the phone was 'designed inside and out to be smart'. He said the Pixel's new camera was better than the iPhone 7. 'It's the best smartphone camera anyone has made,' he said.  Pixel has a 12.3 megapixel camera, and software optimized to improve image quality.  Pixel has a 12.3 megapixel camera, and software optimized to improve image quality It also has a new video stabilization algorithm that Google says is the best on the market.  The firm will also offer free storage on its servers for photographs and video.  Sabrina Ellis of Google  said the firm will pre-install its Duo messaging app on the Pixel phone.   GOOGLE TAKES ON AMAZON'S ECHO WITH HOME SPEAKER The firm also revealed its Google Home smart speaker will go on sale in November. The 'Home' device will feature Google's digital 'Assistant' service, a voice-activated personal butler that can search the internet, play music or perform other useful tasks.  Users will be able to simply talk to the speaker, telling it what to do or asking it questions in normal English.  The device, called 'Home', is an internet-connected speaker, similar to Amazon's Echo, and was first unveiled in May The gadget is also a high quality speaker, Google claimed at the unveiling in May, allowing users to play back music from online services of a phone. It can also control other speakers, forming a voice controlled multi room hifi system, and control other devices such as lights and Google's Nest thermostat. 'Assistant' is the company's answer to similar concierge services from rivals, including Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana.  The speaker will come in six different colors, and be available from November 4th At the unveiling of Home in May, Google boss Sundar Pichai said:  'We think of the assistant as an ambient experience that goes across devices - this is more than just phones, it will be on devices they wear, in their car and in their living rooms.' The leading tech companies are all competing to assist consumers in their online activities such as shopping, since that gives the companies a better chance of selling advertising or other services. Home-based systems like the Echo are taking on more importance with the advent of improved voice technology, according to Julie Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. The internet-connected personal-assistant for the home, was first unveiled by Mario Quieroz, vice president of Google, at an event in May 'We spent a lot of time optimizing Pixel so you can get through the day. 'Pixel can get you up to seven hours of power with 15 minutes of charging. ' He showed off several demonstrations of the new phone, using speech to ask it a number of questions.   The firm also revealed its Google Home smart speaker will go on sale in November.  Rishi Chandra of Google showed off its speech recognition capabilities. 'It's really simple, and sounds great,' he said.  For music, it will learn which service people tend to use and automatically use it when they ask. CAN GOOGLE'S $129 ROUTER BOOST YOUR WIFI?  Google made one surprise announcement at the event - a $129 router called Google wifi. Several can be placed around homes to boost their wifi signals, instead of having one main router. 'Enjoy a fast signal in every room, on every device,' the firm boasts. 'Google Wifi is a new type of connected system that replaces your router for seamless coverage throughout your home.' The system is designed as a connected system of points that are placed throughout the home to provide bedroom to basement connectivity.  It also gives you easy control of your network so that you can stay in control. Users can also ask it to do things such as 'play that Shakira song from Zootopia'. The speaker will also play users a daily briefing, and, in a shot at Amazon, can create a shopping list for users.  'It's one assistant across all your devices,' he said. The speaker will also allow people to control their TVs if they have Google's Chromecast installed.  'This is truly hands free voice control.'  It has also been integrated into YouTube, allowing users to ask for shows on Google's video service, and Netflix compatibility is set to arrive soon, Google said. Users can also ask to see their photos which can be displayed on the TV. 'We can also voice control your speaker system with a $35 Chromecast audio,' he said.  Google has also optimized the device to listen for the nearest speaker, so several can be installed across the home.  Clay Bavor revealed the firm's new $79 Daydream VR headset, that will use the new Pixel as its screen. Google also showed off Google Wifi, a new $129 home router that can boost speeds. Mario Queiroz showed off Google Home, the firm's AI speaker. Clay Bavor revealed the firm's new Daydream VR headset, that will use the new Pixel as its screen.  'We wanted to make something that's comfortable and easy to use,' he said. It also unveiled a 4K version of its Chromecast, called Chromecast Ultra. 'It doesn't look like other VR headsets - we weren't inspired by gadgets, we looked at what people wear. 'We crafted out headset out of fabrics.'  The headset will come in red, white and slate.  GOOGLE'S DAYDREAM VR HEADSET Earlier this year, the Mountain View-based firm announced its plans for Daydream, which will be a more advanced version of Cardboard. Clay Bavor revealed the firm's new Daydream VR headset, that will use the new Pixel as its screen and go on sale in November for $79. Clay Bavor revealed the firm's new Daydream VR headset, that will use the new Pixel as its screen. 'We wanted to make something that's comfortable and easy to use,' he said. 'It doesn't look like other VR headsets - we weren't inspired by gadgets, we looked at what people wear. 'We crafted out headset out of fabrics.'  The headset will come in red, white and slate.  In May, the firm announced plans for its Daydream platform, which will be a more advanced version of Cardboard. The VR platform will rely on the user's phone as the basis, with a more comfortable headset to hold the device (pictured) However, Google has been clear that its long term plans stretch beyond smartphones, to more substantial standalone hardware in future.  Rumours suggest that staff from a VR project - which has reportedly been shelved - have been drafted to work on a high end headset project instead.  Thanks to a number of leaks, Android fans have already seen the phone from almost every angle. Now, high definition shots, leaked by US carrier Verizon, show the Pixel face on and side on in blue and silver models. Google's new products all include AI capabilities The firm also showed off Google Wifi, a new $129 home router that can boost speeds. Several can be linked together in different rooms to boost coverage. It also unveiled a 4K version of its Chromecast, called Chromecast Ultra.    Read more: Google Pixel smartphones leaked by Carphone Warehouse Verizon Just Leaked the Google Pixel, Featuring Something Called 'Google Magic' Share or comment on this article e-mail 7 shares Most watched News videos Road rage incident turns personal as drivers insult each other Prince Harry announces Sydney will host the 2018 Invictus games Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters New Marks and Spencer Christmas ad places Mrs Claus as hero Father surprises his daughter after he comes out of present box Huge brawl erupts at Artesian Commons Park in Washington Trump pledges not to take salary if President during 2015 rally Two dogs brutally attack mother and child outside their home Ruth Langsford fights back tears over 'final walk' dog Walnut Bodybuilder with '0% body fat' flexes her muscles in the gym Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power Was the Hillary hiking in the woods photo staged?

It has the “best smartphone camera ever” perhaps (that’s still yet to be officially determined, other than by DxOMark), there are some hardware optimizations, and the phone sports the super-new and super-fast Snapdragon 821. But other than that, Google is relying mostly on software to set this phone apart from the crowd. That’s fine by me, except for the fact that most of the software features Google is touting are only artificially exclusive to the Pixel. One of the most obvious is Assistant, Google’s AI-powered evolution of Google Now that the Mountain View company is putting in a lot of its new products. It’s built-in to Allo, it’s the central interface for Google Home, and of course, it’s front-and-center with a new home button on the Pixel phones. What frustrates me, though, is that there’s not really any reason other than helping push the Pixel out the door to hold it back from last year’s Nexus phones. Google, the company that has long pioneered Android as “open,” is closing some things off… This reminds me a lot of the launch of Siri on the iPhone 4S, which Apple famously touted as the big selling point of the phone — while holding the feature back from software updates to the iPhone 4. It was purely a software feature, and Apple used it as the central selling point. Perhaps this isn’t the best comparison, though, because the performance difference between iPhone 4 and 4S was a lot more substantial than, let’s say, the Nexus 6P and the Pixel XL. Apple might have had some justification for that decision. Google also has some justification, but it really comes only in the form of exclusivity and marketing. As our own Ben Schoon even admitted himself, a big reason he jumped on the Pixel bandwagon is because it just has lots of software exclusives that are hard to pass up. Assistant is the big one, but the Pixel and Pixel XL also offer 24/7 customer care, a lot of Android 7.1 features, the Pixel Launcher, and unlimited full quality photo and video backup with Google Photos. Some of these will eventually make their way to some of the newer Nexus devices, but for now, Google is using them to get you to spend $650+ on a phone that actually leaves a decent amount to be desired in the hardware department. The physical design isn’t exactly groundbreaking, there’s no waterproofing, there’s no OIS, there’s only one bottom-firing speaker… Perhaps the other justification Google has for limiting Assistant’s launch on older Nexus devices for the time being is to give it — and Google — a chanchere’s only one bottom-firing speaker… Perhaps the other justification Google has for limiting Assistant’s launch on older Nexus devices for the time being is to give it — and Google — a chance to learn some more and iron out some kinks before being pushed out to the “masses” (I put that in quotes because the number of people using Nexus devices is insanely small compared to the entire smartphone market). But I don’t really buy that, because Google already released Assistant publicly in the form of Allo. And anyone on any device — including iPhone — can download it and try it out right now. Rather, I think that Google wants its hardcore Nexus fanbase to help it promote the Pixel and get some sales moving out the gate. Honestly, if Google had released (or even directly promised) the Assistant in a software update — or even a developer preview — for the Nexus 6P and 5X, how many of Google’s most loyal fans who bought a Nexus last year would skip out on the Pixel and Pixel XL for now (or even entirely)? I think the number would be pretty decent. But it’s still annoying to me. Google has long trumpeted Android as an open platform and has never used software exclusivity to sell its hardware like this before. It’s a very Apple-like move, and only in the worst way. Google seems to be waking up to the fact that top-to-bottom control of its software and hardware will be the only way it can produce phones that have the “fit and finish” to compete well with the iPhone (although we aren’t really seeing the benefits of this with the Pixel, yet), but unfortunately they’re throwing long-time Nexus fans and loyalists under the bus in the process. Other than pushing sales of the Pixel, there’s no reason the Nexus 6P can’t have Assistant today. This has to be artificial for the most part, because even Google itself says that they want to allow 3rd-parties to put the Assistant on anything. “We imagine a future where the assistant will be able to help from any context and from any kind of device,” the company said at its event earlier this week. They even mentioned the eventual possibility that Assistant could run on a Raspberry Pi. And one of our anonymous tipsters (if you’re reading this, feel free to send us an anonymous encrypted email, we’d really love to chat), who has told us some things that ended up confirmed, also suggests that this is the case. We’re hearing from said tipster that internal developer Nexus devices have the Assistant running “perfectly” (The Verge also mentioned it running on the Nexus 6P in a lengthy feature). Further, this person confirms the obvious, saying that Google is holding it back for a some amount of time to give Pixel the exclusive. The Android 7.1 change log that Android Police obtained, however, clearly distinguishes which features are Pixel-exclusive. The developer preview for Android 7.1 is said to be coming at least to the 6P, 5X, and Pixel C, by the end of the year. Here’s what Google told us on the matter: There will be certain features — such as the Google Assistant — that will be unique to Pixel before we make a decision to offer it up to the rest of the ecosystem.  With some of these features currently unique to Pixel, we’re carefully experimenting with these changes to assess user reaction and feedback. So when and which devices in Google’s portfolio will get the Assistant is entirely up in the air for the moment. Which, I don’t know about you, is probably a sign of things to come. It’s clear that the Pixel line is going to basically have its own fork of Android (which, actually, was true of the Nexus phones as well considering they didn’t run technically pure “stock” AOSP). What’s confusing is that we’ve now heard of a couple cases where Google is considering Nexus-like devices. The Huawei tablet that we’ve (and Evan Blass, and some others) heard about is one of them (which likely won’t be Pixel-branded, as Huawei refused to let Google remove its branding for the Pixel), but Android Police also noted that Huawei is being “solicited by Google” to make a mid-range smartphone as well for launch next year. Assistant is probably just the first of many features that make up the “more opinionated” exclusives of the Pixel line, and while it’s exciting that Google is taking the bull by the horns and trying to deliver a unique and compelling top-to-bottom smartphone package, it’s also going to be unfortunate for those that want to stick with Android but would perhaps prefer hardware from other companies (or in this case, would like to stick with Google’s hardware from last year for a while).

Cherlynn Low , @cherlynnlow 10.07.16 in Personal Computing 1225 Shares Share Tweet Share Save In a world occupied by Siri, Cortana and Alexa, Google Assistant is a bit of an anomaly. It's the first widely used voice assistant to eschew a female name, which the company reportedly did to avoid giving it a personality. The company would rather you imagined yourself talking directly to "Google the search engine" than a go-between. Avoiding a gendered name just happened to be a happy coincidence, it seems. Despite Google (perhaps unintentionally) shunning obvious sexism in its AI, it still fell into the gender bias trap by giving Assistant a female voice. And that's a problem, a problem that will require the collective effort of the industry's powerhouses to fix. A Google spokesperson told Engadget that the company started with a female voice for Assistant "as it's something we already had available via the Google voice search technology." This is the same voice that's been used in many Android devices for years now, responding to our "OK Google" commands and requests. It's been extensively fine tuned and worked on over time. A male voice was not available in Android, except via the text-to-speech output settings, which required users to install and switch to new language packs (such as British English). Google's spokesperson said that the company is "thinking about how to expand beyond a female voice but (has) nothing to share at this time." Using a woman's voice for a bot named "Assistant" is a problem because it ties that subservient role directly to gender. But the thing is, it's not Google's fault. It's not even really the tech industry's fault. Studies have shown that people prefer female voices for biological and historical reasons. The modern generation has also grown used to them -- in-car GPS units and plenty of other audio devices have long used calm-sounding feminine voices to talk to us. It's so ingrained in our collective subconscious that, even though you can already change Siri's voice to a male one, the female version is the one that's become iconic. Can you imagine Siri as a guy? Probably not. But it's time for a change. AI makers can start by offering options. It's not going to be easy to just implement a new voice altogether, but at least Google says it's thinking about the issue. Amazon and Microsoft still don't have male options for their assistants and don't appear to have plans to change that. Apple is the only one right now that lets you pick from a variety of languages, accents and genders for Siri, though it still uses a female name. That should also be changed. It's not enough to just offer male vocal alternatives without changing the character's basic identity. Companies should also work towards providing different characters of all genders that users can choose and avoid defaulting to a woman all the time. Creating options is a good first step, but it's important for these tech titans to work toward crafting a gender-neutral assistant. Startup Kasisto has proven it's possible with its androgynous MyKai chatbot, although, like Facebook's M, it doesn't have a voice. If these bots are meant to be nothing more than helpers that yield to our every will, it's better to dehumanize them altogether by not assigning genders than to pretend we have a person (or a feminine non-human) at our beck and call.

By Andy Boxall — October 7, 2016 11:51 AM Subscribe to this topic Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Apple iPhone 7 MSRP $649.00 DT Recommended Product Learn More Look out Apple, Samsung, and just about every other smartphone maker out there, because Google’s coming for you with the new Pixel smartphones. There are two, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and they run the very latest version of Android, look super, and have some exclusive features to make sure smartphone fans sit up and take notice. They come just a few weeks after Apple’s latest iPhone models went on sale. Like the Pixel there are two different types, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and they both look great, have some special features not seen on other iPhones, and as always with an Apple launch, made people sit up and take notice. Related: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 — which 5-inch flagship is right for you? Inevitably, if you’re about to buy a new phone, these two will be on your list. The Pixel naturally goes up against the iPhone 7, so which one should you buy? Each phone has its own positive and negative points, and we’ve given them an thorough examination to find out which deserves your money. Google Pixel iPhone 7 Size 143.8 × 69.5 × 7.3 mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 in) 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.87 ounces (138 grams) Screen 5-inch AMOLED 4.7-inch Retina HD LED backlit screen Resolution 1,080 × 1,920 pixels (441 ppi) 1,334 x 750 pixels (326 ppi) OS Android 7.1 iOS 10 Storage 32, 128GB 32, 128, 256GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 A 10 Fusion with 64-bit architecture, M10 motion coprocessor RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12.3MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 7MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30, 60, or 120fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30 or 60fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated Yes, IP67 rated Battery 2,770mAh 1,960mAh Ports USB Type-C Lightning Marketplace Google Store Apple App Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, Jet Black, gold, rose gold, silver Availability Verizon, Google Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile Price $650 $650 DT review Hands-on  3.5 out of 5 stars Performance The Google Pixel is bang up to date with its processor. It uses the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which is a small but significant update to the Snapdragon 820, seen in most major flagship phones released during 2016. The 64-bit Snapdragon 821 has four cores and gets a 10 percent performance bump over the already speedy Snapdragon 820, a 5 percent increase in graphical capabilities, is more energy efficient, and can use Quick Charge 3.0 for even faster battery recharging. Apple doesn’t use a Snapdragon chip, and instead uses the A10 Fusion chip of its own design. Apparently it’s 40 percent faster than the A9, according to Apple, and it’s the first time the company has used a quad-core chip. Both chips utilize the multiple cores in a similar way, splitting the workload across them to reduce power consumption during easy tasks. The Snapdragon 821 is so new, we’ve not seen a phone with it inside to test out yet, so establishing any of our own benchmarks is impossible. Early benchmark results seen in Geekbench 4 return a multi-core score of 4,089. The iPhone 7 managed 5,600. Does that make the Pixel a slowcoach? No, and we’re wary of that unconfirmed benchmark, as the Galaxy S7 regularly scores over 5,000, and it uses a Snapdragon 820 chip. At this early stage, we can’t say either phone is faster than the other. However, we know the iPhone 7 is quick, and have no reason to think the Snapdragon 821 will be any different. Elsewhere, the Pixel comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and doesn’t have a MicroSD card slot, sadly. The iPhone 7 adds a 256GB option to the list, so if masses of storage are important to you (and you can stomach the extra cost), the Apple phone has a slight advantage here. Winner: Tie (pending further tests) Design This is ultimately going to come down to personal preference, but there are a few things you should keep in mind as you size the two up. The Pixel is made of metal, glass, and plastic. The glass panel on the rear provides the antenna with room to breathe, while the plastic sections recall manufacturer HTC’s Desire range of phones. It’s thin at 7.1mm and light at 143 grams. For the iPhone 7, Apple has blended in the antenna breaks more than on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, decluttering the rear panel, but keeping the camera bump. Google has avoided this by slightly enlarging the body itself. The iPhone 7’s body is made from aluminum, is 7.1mm thick, and a little lighter than the Pixel at 138 grams. In our hands-on, the Pixel is described as being, “high-end, not too heavy, or fragile, even with the half-glass back.” Concerns over the screen bezel are also unfounded, with it appearing larger in pictures than in real life. The iPhone 7 is extremely comfortable to hold, with wonderfully curved sides, and corners that nestle in the palm nicely. Arguably, the Pixel looks a lot like an iPhone, but this doesn’t really bother us — both are great looking phones. Google gives you the choice of a white, black, or limited edition blue Pixel, and it’s the blue that really catches the eye. The iPhone 7’s jet black color is the elusive limited edition for showoffs, and it’s the regular matte black that’s the winner, as it neatly conceals the antenna lines for a smooth look. Google’s phones have never been stunners, while the iPhone 7 has a class that the Pixel can’t quite match, supreme in-hand comfort, and a real premium build, which along with its lighter body and wider choice of colors sees it edge out the Pixel here. Winner: iPhone 7 Battery and audio Google has selected a 2,770mAh battery for the Pixel, complete with fast charging provided by the Snapdragon 821 and Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 feature. Plug it in using the USB Type-C cable and after 15 minutes it’ll be at 70 percent capacity. We’ve not used the phone for long enough to judge the overall use time on a daily basis. Inside the iPhone 7 is a 1,960mAh battery and in our review, we have seen 12 hours of solid use, and more than 40 percent left at the end of a day. There’s no fast charging though, and recharging the iPhone 7 will take longer than the Pixel. Neither phone has wireless charging as standard. The iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, and audio performance is vastly improved over the iPhone 6S while the Pixel has a single downward firing speaker. However, the Pixel retains a 3.5mm headphone socket, while Apple forces you to use headphones with a Lightning connector or Bluetooth. More battery capacity, faster charging, and a traditional headphone socket make the Pixel a clear winner. Winner: Google Pixel Display Looking at the numbers, the Pixel should run away here. The 5-inch display is an AMOLED panel, therefore producing deep blacks and strong colors. It has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution and a 441ppi pixel density, is covered in protective 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4, and Google claims it has an excellent viewing angle with little decrease in brightness. Related: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The iPhone’s Retina HD LED-backlit screen measures 4.7-inches, has a 1,334 x 750 pixel resolution for a 326ppi pixel density, and also a 2.5D piece of glass over the front. Although it has a lower resolution, it does still look great, but the Pixel’s AMOLED screen and higher pixel count will automatically make pictures, webpages, and games look better. However, there is one thing in the iPhone 7’s favor, and that’s 3D Touch, Apple’s pressure sensitive system. Here, additional functionality can be accessed with a harder screen press, and it’s surprisingly helpful, especially with iOS 10 installed. The Pixel doesn’t have this feature. Despite this, it’s as much a software feature as it is a display feature, giving the Pixel the win. Winner: Google Pixel Camera Let’s start with a spec shootout. The Pixel and the iPhone 7 both have 12-megapixel rear cameras. The Pixel has an f/2.0 aperture against the iPhone 7’s f/1.8 aperture, which should let in a little more light, plus it has a quad-LED flash rather than the Pixel’s dual-LED. However, while both have phase detection autofocus, laser autofocus only comes on the Pixel. Both have image stabilization, but only the iPhone uses traditional OIS, as the Pixel has a clever system that utilizes the phone’s gyroscope for smoothing out video. We’re big fans of the iPhone 7’s camera, although consider the iPhone 7 Plus to be the real winner, but have yet to really put the Pixel’s camera to the test. In our hands-on with the phone, we noted the speed with which it captured and processed photos, along with its low-light performance and cool HDR+ mode. The Pixel also has free, unlimited full resolution photo storage in the cloud through Google Photos, while you’ll have to pay for extra iCloud space or full-res Google Photos storage if you own an iPhone. Until we get our hands on the Pixel for a full review, we must turn to well-respected camera testers DxOMark, where the Pixel received an 89 rating, the highest of any smartphone yet. The iPhone 7 isn’t far behind with 86 though. It’s likely to be a tight contest between the iPhone 7 and the Pixel here, just like it is between the iPhone and the Galaxy S7, so we’re calling it a tie for now. Winner: Tie (Pending further tests) Durability Unless these phones are securely wrapped up in a case, neither are going to come off well in the event of a nasty fall. Glass and aluminum bodies aren’t designed to withstand much shock. It’s also worth mentioning that if you choose the jet black iPhone 7 and don’t wrap it in a case, expect it to gather up some scratches and scuffs pretty quickly. Apple knows the special finish is delicate, and recommends the use of a case. Apple now edges ahead of the Pixel here, having made the iPhone meet IP67 standards of splash, water, and dust resistance. We’ve tested this out, and the iPhone happily continues working after taking a bath, something the Pixel is unlikely to do even with its basic IP53 protection. Accidents happen, and if they involve the wet stuff, you’ll be glad it was the iPhone and not the Pixel underwater. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Software If design was a difficult category to judge, due to personal preference playing a considerable role, software is also subjective. Unlike pitting a phone like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 against the Pixel, Apple is prompt and regular with its software updates, which matches how Google will react with its new Pixel devices. The Pixel comes with Android 7.1 installed, the very latest version of the operating system, which can’t (and won’t) be found in this form anywhere else. The Apple iPhone has iOS 10. The two are very different, yet also quite alike. There are icons to tap, a virtual assistant to help — Assistant on the Pixel and Siri on the iPhone — and special messaging apps for both. On the Pixel, it’s Duo for video calls and Allo for chats, while on the iPhone there’s FaceTime and iMessage. Downsides of Google’s operating system don’t really apply here. It’s going to get regular updates, there’s no messy user interface over the top, and you’re assured of the latest version for at least a few years yet. Apple treats the iPhone in the same way. There’s little to choose between them when it comes to app stores either, with both being equally well stocked with apps, books, movies, and more. Winner: Tie Pricing and availability Wallets at the ready? They better be, because you’re going to have to open them pretty wide to get either one of these phones. Unlocked, without a contract, the Pixel will cost you $650 for the 32GB model or $750 for the 128GB, and it can be purchase a retail store. Contract prices vary for the iPhone, but it’s available with each major carrier in the U.S., while the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive. This hurts the Pixel here. We don’t like being forced onto one carrier and many people buy their phones in stores. However, there is good news for the Pixel: You can buy it unlocked from Google and get the same month-to-month financing you get with the iPhone at carriers. We’d suggest not buying either phone locked to a network, or fixed into a contract, anyway. There are financing options available for both the Pixel and the iPhone 7 through Google and Apple respectively too. However, be aware if you choose an iPhone on AT&T or Sprint with financing through Apple, it’ll be locked to that network. International buyers will also find it easier to buy an iPhone 7, with 25 countries on the list at launch, and more than 30 having been added since then. Others are coming in October. Google is only selling the Pixel in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany at the moment. Wider availability, more carrier options, and equal pricing sees the iPhone take this category. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Overall winner: iPhone 7 (for now) It’s three category wins for the iPhone 7, and two for the Pixel, with three overall ties. However, two of those sections will likely have a different result when we’ve played with the Pixel for a longer amount of time, so there’s still everything to play for. It’s interesting to see where the iPhone 7 beats the Google Pixel, particularly because durability and price have long been problem areas for Apple, and winners for Android phones. Apple has turned that around with the iPhone 7. The Pixel has it beaten when it comes to display, battery, and the presence of a 3.5mm headphone socket. Right now, because you can buy it in more places, with fewer restrictions, and it won’t stop working if it gets wet, the iPhone 7 has to take the win. Don’t dismiss the Pixel yet though, we’ve yet to test out two areas where it could very easily fight back and take the win. Check back soon.

Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Comes to Life With Google Tango Augmented Reality With augmented reality pegged as the next big thing in mobile apps, Google Tango will be a welcomed feature of the Phab 2 Pro smartphone. Here's how Tango separates the Phab 2 Pro from other smartphones. Google Tango Makes the Phab 2 Pro Interesting Support for Google Tango is the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro's main attraction. The feature is an augmented reality engine that uses the device's camera to see virtual elements over the real world. Better yet, Tango can measure objects and digitally visualize items and spaces to help users navigate in a house, factory or office. The Phab 2 Pro is the first smartphone to come with Tango, making it interesting to anyone interested in the future of augmented reality. The Display Is Huge To deliver a better Tango experience, Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro comes with a 6.4-inch screen. The display has a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 pixels and can adjust to variable lighting conditions so it can still work outside in direct sunlight. The Phab 2 Pro will ship with one of the best (and most attractive) smartphone displays on the market. Camera Technology Is Solid The Phab 2 Pro comes with a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera to complement its 8-megapixel front-facing camera. It also has a third camera on the back (its sensor size hasn't been revealed) that helps the smartphone render 3D images. If Tango takes off, expect more smartphones to come with a three-camera array—and for sensors to load up on megapixels. Snapdragon 652 Optimized for Augmented Reality The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, which has less power than the Snapdragon 820 and 821 chips users would find in other Android-based handsets. However, Lenovo was quick to note that the Snapdragon 652 has been optimized to work with Tango, which stands in stark contrast to other processors. So, while the Phab 2 Pro's processor might not be as high-powered as some of those in other Android devices, it's required to get the most out of Tango. It Has a High-Capacity Big Battery With Turbo Charging Lenovo has kept quiet about how long its Phab 2 Pro's battery can last on a single charge, but expect it to hold up quite well. The smartphone will ship with a 4,050mAh battery, one of the largest cells on the market. In addition, Lenovo says the battery will come with turbocharging so users can get back to work more quickly. There's a Fingerprint Sensor for Security Lenovo hasn't forgotten about security in the Phab 2 Pro and will offer a fingerprint sensor on the rear of the device. While the company hasn't said whether the smartphone will come with hardware-based encryption, a fingerprint scanner will at least make it more difficult for hackers to get into the smartphone or make unauthorized payments through Android Pay. Few Apps Are Currently Available Since the Phab 2 Pro is the first smartphone to support Tango, it's perhaps no surprise that the Google Play marketplace has only a few apps that support the smartphone. In fact, as of this writing, the marketplace has just a little more than 20 Tango-ready apps available, including some that focus solely on gaming, such as Castle Defender. But it's a start. Available Apps Are Appealing In addition to interesting gaming apps, there are a few Tango-ready programs that might actually appeal to corporate users. For instance, one app, Tango MeasureIt, lets users measure the distance between real-life objects. Another, Tango Constructor, lets developers record and view 3D models of their surroundings from the handset. As more apps come online, it's likely that devices running the Tango AR environment will gain greater support from business users. The Storage and Memory Should Suffice The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro ships with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. While more storage would be good, it's the RAM that counts here. With 4GB of RAM, the Phab 2 Pro should be able to handle augmented reality apps with ease and simultaneously support other Android functions. Less RAM, and the Phab 2 Pro likely wouldn't offer a suitable Tango experience. Putting the Pricing Into Perspective Lenovo hasn't set a specific delivery date in November for the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Whenever it hits store shelves, look for the Phab 2 Pro to come unlocked in the United States and sell for $499. To put that into perspective, most other high-end devices, including Apple's iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, start at $649. 10 Features Samsung Should Build Into the Galaxy S8 Smartphone View Slideshow » Why DNS Servers Are an Unprotected Back Door into Your Network View Slideshow » 11 Revolutionary Advances in Wireless Tech in 2016 View Slideshow » Panasonic Updates Toughpad FZ-G1 With More Power, Longer Battery Life View Slideshow » Broadcom, Qualcomm Latest Acquirers in Busy Chip Space View Slideshow » Why Donald Trump and Silicon Valley Don't See Eye to Eye View Slideshow » CIOs Expect Steady Growth in Health Care IT Spending, Cyber-Threats View Slideshow » Ransomware Takes Off, Web Browsers Under Attack: Kaspersky Report View Slideshow » TrueOS Succeeds PC-BSD Desktop-Friendly Unix OS View Slideshow » Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro View Slideshow » View All Slideshows >   Google Taogo, an augmented reality technology that helps devices "see" the world around them, is soon coming to store shelves. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the first smartphone to run the Tango AR environment, is set to launch in November, Google has confirmed. The Phab 2 Pro was supposed to reach the market in the summer, but was pushed back twice—once to September and again to the "fall." Now that Lenovo's release plans have been revealed, it's time to take a closer look at the Phab 2 Pro. And at first glance, it seems like a winner. In addition to Tango support, which could appeal to consumers and enterprise users, the Lenovo smartphone comes with a 6.4-inch screen, three cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor optimized for Tango and ample storage. As time goes on and more AR apps come to the Google Play marketplace, the smartphone could prove even more useful. This slide show discusses the Phab 2 Pro's features and how the addition of AR technology makes the introduction of this smartphone so highly anticipated.                       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend                             Topics by Type Android Apple Cloud Database Developer Enterprise Apps Innovation IT Management   Mobile Networking PC Hardware Security Servers Small Business Storage Virtualization Articles by Type News & Analysis Slideshows Blogs Reviews Video   Contact Us About eWeek Sitemap Blogs Security Watch Upfront First Read Storage Station Careers Google Watch Special Features eWeekChat eWeek 30th Anniversary Cloud Backup Project Center Next Generation Firewall Project Center Big Data Analytics Project Center Research Center       Property of QuinStreet Enterprise.

Home, Google's new smart speaker, will be able to use voice to control Netflix and other video on Google's Chromecast streaming device. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Google is pretty serious about its plan to take over your home. The company on Tuesday offered more details on its smart speaker and home hub, Google Home, as an answer to Amazon's Echo speaker. But Google -- perhaps knowing that it's starting a little bit behind -- has been sure to hook the Home into Google's broader suite of services to make the concept of the smart home more affordable. Home will work with Google's Chromecast video and audio streaming devices -- $69 and $35, respectively -- so that customers can upgrade their current speakers and televisions with little fuss and not that much cash. When the whole system is in place, users can use their voices to call up YouTube videos on their televisions or ask for a specific song to play through their non-Google speakers. Home itself will also be able to play music. And the Google Assistant built into the speaker has been designed to be able to find the track you want even if you aren't sure of its name. On stage, Google Home was able to correctly pull up the song "Try Everything" by Shakira, after being asked to play "the Shakira song from 'Zootopia'" -- a way of phrasing the query that could sound incomprehensible to a computer that can't tap into the wider world of Google's information. Home is also designed to work with third-party apps, so it will be able to control some smart light bulb systems such as Philips Hue. Google has also worked out partnerships with some services -- including Uber, meaning users can order a car by voice. And the hub has a mute button, if consumers aren't comfortable having the device always listening for the trigger phrase, "Ok, Google." Home comes in six shades -- copper, snow, carbon, mango, marine and violet -- and costs $129. It will be available at the Google Store, Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Target starting Oct. 20 and is available for pre-order immediately. The company also announced a new system of routers, called Google Wi-Fi. It's a pack of smaller routers that work together, rather than a single router that plugs into your modem. This should help eliminate "dead spots" in your house, by letting you place them more widely throughout your home. It will cost $129 for a single router and $299 for a three-pack. It will be available for pre-order in November at the Google Store, Amazon, Best Buy and Wal-Mart.

No, neither do we. Reports on Friday revealed Google is willing to cast off its largely unloved universal chat app in favour of the new and improved Duo video calling app. Google is no longer requiring Android phone makers to include Hangouts on their Google Mobile Services-approved phones. Its place will be taken by Duo, per AndroidPolice sources. Related: Google Pixel hands-on - the ultimate small phone? “Today, we are announcing that Google Duo will replace Hangouts within the suite of core GMS apps, and Hangouts will become GMS Optional for telephony products. This change will take effect on December 1, 2016,” Google told hardware makers. Hangouts, which includes instant messaging, voice and group video chatting will be relegated to an optional extra for manufacturers and will remain available via the Play Store. Interestingly, although Duo will be a mandatory inclusion for Android phone-makers down the line, the Allo chat app, powered by Google Assistant, will not. As the original source points out, Allo has a huge number of competitors in the field, namely Facebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp. See also: Google Allo tips and tricks With that in mind, it is strange Google wouldn’t give it a leg up by ensuring it arrives on all Android Phones, so perhaps this will change in future.

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL Smartphones – Things Everyone Should Know About the Phones By AdminOctober 7, 2016 Newest No Comments 0 0 0 October 14th 2016  – Google unleashed the new information about its first ever smartphone PIXEL and PIXEL XL – the next step in Google’s in-house hardware development. Google markets the phones as a strictly in-house operation, despite HTC constructing the phones. Pixel costs same as much as the other new phones  The price of the pixel starts at $649 same as the new I Phone 7 and it is slight cheaper than the samsung S7 at $670 Google announced that the pre-order of Pixel and Pixel XL smart phones start at October 13th in India and it will be also available in small retailers and Flipkart, Reliance Digital and croma. Google Pixel Price                   India                 US  Google Pixel 32GB                   57000               $649 Google Pixel 128GB                 66000               $749 Google Pixel XL 32GB              67000               $769 Google Pixel XL 128GB            76000               $869 It has the best camera of any smartphone Google proudly touted this fact in most of the Pixel’s marketing. DxOMark gave the camera a score of 89, the highest in the industry. Apple’s iPhone 7 scores at 86. The camera boasts blur reduction, stabilizers, fisheye panoramas, and “photosphere” capabilities. The Pixel Smartburst feature allows users to take photos in rapid succession so as to not miss any of the action. Google Assistant keeps your life together Pixel is the first phone to feature Google Assistant built into the programming (duh, since it’s a Google phone). The Assistant can access photos from both personal storage and the internet. The Assistant translates across devices and into the Google Home system. Holding the Pixel’s home button activates the assistant. With the entire power of Google’s search engine, the assistant can access pretty much everything users need. It offers unlimited photo and video storage for its devices. Included with the phone is free unlimited storage for high-resolution images and video. The storage even takes off size limitations and compression issues users currently experience uploading to Google Photos. Google Pixel specifications The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, with two cores clocked at 1.6GHz, and two cores clocked at 2.15GHz.

By Jessica Toonkel and Julia Love, Reuters Posted Oct. 07, 2016, at 2:23 p.m. Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc. Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua of MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc.’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel, but Mario Queiroz, Google vice president of product management, told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign.” Story continues below advertisement.

(Reuters/Mark Blinch) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging October 07, 2016 Becoming internet-famous may seem quick and easy, but it certainly doesn’t come cheap. José Javier, a 12-year-old trumpet player in Spain, decided to promote his band, Los Salerosos, through his YouTube channel—and found himself stuck with a €100,000 ($112,000) bill from Google, El País reported (link in Spanish). The schoolboy had signed up for Google AdWords, thinking that he would earn money every time someone clicked on his ad (as users can with Google’s AdSense program). Little did he know that it is the ad’s creator who foots the bill under AdWords’ “pay-per-user” program, which gives publishers the means to pay for priority placements of ads on the site. It’s apparently a common enough confusion that Google has a page explaining the difference between AdWords and AdSense. For the aspiring YouTube star from Valencia’s Torrevieja region, this was an expensive mistake: It only took a couple of months, mid-August to early October, to rack up the astronomical bill. His mother, Inma Quesada, was caught off guard when the family’s bank raised red flags about a €19,700 charge from Google in early September. Javier’s parents put a block on the account, but that didn’t stop the search engine giant from billing another €78,000. Quesada told El País that Javier was able to set up the Google AdWords account by giving just the name and account number of the savings account his family had set up for future costs like his driving license. Luckily for the young Spaniard, Google investigated the curious case after reports surfaced in the local media. Recognizing his youthful mistake, they wrote off the entire amount on Wednesday (Oct. 5). “We have not received any monies from this user and we are canceling the outstanding AdWords balance,” a Google spokesperson told Quartz. AdWords, like many of the company’s online services, has age limits restricting its use, but the company made a one-off concession this time to cancel the bill. The spokesperson recommended that families look to Google’s Safety Center page for families to prevent their kids from making such errors.

REUTERS/Regis DuvignauMore By Jessica Toonkel and Julia Love (Reuters) - Google's new "Pixel" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics<005930.KS> and Apple Inc .

Here's How It Can Beat Google If Mark Zuckerberg wants to bring virtual reality to the masses, this is his chance. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a reporter for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Reporter, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Soon after Facebook bought Oculus VR for $2 billion back in 2014, Mark Zuckerberg declared he wanted to take virtual reality mainstream. Now's he's making a big move toward that goal. Zuck revealed that Facebook is working on a new standalone VR headset, which won't require the wires and high power computer that the first version of Oculus Rift needed. The announcement, which did not include a release date or a price for the headset, came during the Oculus Connect conference on Thursday in San Jose. Oculus's Rift, one of the most hyped VR productsesearch Confirms Paper Problems The AIIM report findings were confirmed by research from Dallas-based M-Files, which also appeared in the past week. The results show 81 percent of the hundreds of workers surveyed online by M-Files are carrying out at least one print job per day. More importantly, it also shows that more than half of all organizations (55 percent) are still using manual paper-based processes for capturing signatures for documents that require approval. The good news here is that a similar number of respondents (55 percent) said the organization they work in is actively trying to reduce the dependency on paper. "Managing paper documents is inconvenient and expensive. Turning paper documents into digital files leads to a substantial increase in efficiency and reduced operational costs. It's really past time for companies to move beyond paper documents and bulky file cabinets as the default approach for managing important business documents,” Greg Milliken, vice president of marketing at M-Files Corporation, said in a statement.  OpenText Upgrades Exstream Waterloo, Ontario-based OpenText released the latest version of OpenText Exstream which, according to the company, will help organizations with digital transformation projects.

SUBSCRIBE Facebook’s new Events app could be a Trojan Horse rival to Google Calendar Facebook's Events from Facebook app offers an in-app calendar that can sync schedules from other calendars, like Apple's iCal, Microsoft's Exchange and Google Calendar. Tim Peterson on October 7, 2016 at 1:48 pm More Facebook has become a popular place for people to pencil in their plans. Every day more than 100 million people — about nine percent of Facebook’s daily audience — use the social network’s events feature, per Facebook. So now, Facebook is spinning off events into own mobile app — which may become more than an event-specific calendar and more of a general-purpose calendar a la Google Calendar. On the surface, the Events from Facebook app, announced on Friday, is something people can use to find out what’s going on nearby and what their friends are planning so they can coordinate their plans. But it also contains a calendar that people could eventually use to manage the rest of their schedules, such as work meetings. People can browse events based on when and where they’re scheduled, as well as what types of events they’re interested in attending, including events posted by Pages. They can also check out a map view to plot out plans by proximity and search for events in specific cities. When people RSVP to attend an event, that event will be added to an in-app calendar so that people can keep tabs on their plans. But here’s the really interesting aspect of the in-app calendar: People can sync the Facebook calendar with other calendars synced to their phones, such as Apple’s iCal, Microsoft’s Exchange or Google Calendar, and those events will appear in the Facebook calendar. So at first, Facebook’s calendar offers a low-hassle way to look at your different calendars, much like the iPhone’s Calendar app, and if people become accustomed to using Facebook’s calendar to see their work and personal plans, they might become inclined to use it to also schedule those plans. But that possibility may be hindered by the fact that the events people sign up to attend within Facebook’s app will become publicized on Facebook, which fits with Facebook’s social ethos but not the private nature of people’s personal calendars. Right now the app is only available to iPhone owners in the US, but Facebook said it’ll eventually open up to Android owners as well.

SUBSCRIBE Facebook’s new Events app could be a Trojan Horse rival to Google Calendar Facebook's Events from Facebook app offers an in-app calendar that can sync schedules from other calendars, like Apple's iCal, Microsoft's Exchange and Google Calendar. Tim Peterson on October 7, 2016 at 1:48 pm More Facebook has become a popular place for people to pencil in their plans. Every day more than 100 million people — about nine percent of Facebook’s daily audience — use the social network’s events feature, per Facebook. So now, Facebook is spinning off events into own mobile app — which may become more than an event-specific calendar and more of a general-purpose calendar a la Google Calendar. On the surface, the Events from Facebook app, announced on Friday, is something people can use to find out what’s going on nearby and what their friends are planning so they can coordinate their plans. But it also contains a calendar that people could eventually use to manage the rest of their schedules, such as work meetings. People can browse events based on when and where they’re scheduled, as well as what types of events they’re interested in attending, including events posted by Pages. They can also check out a map view to plot out plans by proximity and search for events in specific cities. When people RSVP to attend an event, that event will be added to an in-app calendar so that people can keep tabs on their plans. But here’s the really interesting aspect of the in-app calendar: People can sync the Facebook calendar with other calendars synced to their phones, such as Apple’s iCal, Microsoft’s Exchange or Google Calendar, and those events will appear in the Facebook calendar. So at first, Facebook’s calendar offers a low-hassle way to look at your different calendars, much like the iPhone’s Calendar app, and if people become accustomed to using Facebook’s calendar to see their work and personal plans, they might become inclined to use it to also schedule those plans. But that possibility may be hindered by the fact that the events people sign up to attend within Facebook’s app will become publicized on Facebook, which fits with Facebook’s social ethos but not the private nature of people’s personal calendars. Right now the app is only available to iPhone owners in the US, but Facebook said it’ll eventually open up to Android owners as well.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Captcha Does Not Block Pokemon Go Scanners, New Encryption Does Posted: Oct 7 2016, 10:30am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Oct 8 2016, 12:50am CDT, in News | Technology News   Credit: Google   Niantic deployment of Google's reCaptcha is not stopping 3rd party developers from scraping Pokemon Go servers. Update: Niantic deployed new encryption blocking all Pokemon scanners and bots. Pokemon Go is putting the spotlight on how weak widely used security technology really is. Niantic has enlisted Google security technology to block 3rd party developers from accessing Pokemon Go servers and extract the valuable location of spawning Pokemon. In addition to that, Niantic also relies on Google's SafetyNet to block the Pokemon Go app from running on rooted devices. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals Update: Niantic has released a new encryption of the protocol blocking all scrapers. It is not just Captcha now the 3rd party developers such as the creator of FastPokeMap have to deal with now. It is another reverse engineering job. They need to find out how the new encryption works before any Pokemon Go scanner or bot is going to work again. This can take days. Both security technologies can be circumvented. Running apps on rooted devices that require SafetyNet verification as been possible before Pokemon Go. Before solutions that hide rooted have been known by relatively small group, now millions more use these techniques so they can run Pokemon on their rooted smartphone.  This attention and wide spread forces Google to improve their security technology. This happened earlier this week with SafetyNet. Solutions like Magisk stopped working. This changed has not just affected Pokemon Go trainers, but anyone who was running Magisk for instance to use Android Pay on rooted phone. There are already methods to circumvent the new improved SafetyNet and Magisk is getting an update that will deal with the changes. This means there will be another round of SafetyNet changes coming soon. Google can't give up the fight. Business partners including banks will come down on them. They already will have increased the pressure on Google.     The situation with reCaptcha is no different. Yesterday we reported that FastPokeMap, the largest Pokemon scanner, is going to fold, but things already changed. The creator of FastPokeMap found a viable solution to deal with the Captcha. First he increased the number of worker accounts significantly from the 500,000 the service used. This reduces the number of captchas FPM triggers. Yesterday they still had 10,000 captchas per second. Secondly, they made a deal with a Captcha solving service to solve the captchas they hit. The end solution is to redirect the captchas to the 15 million daily users of FastPokeMap. This is not trivial and will take some hacking. Captcha solver and captcha solving services have been around since a long time, but now they get a lot of attention becaues of Pokemon Go. Not just large scale scanners have to deal with captchas. Anybody who is running a personal scanner or bot needs to deal with them and they do with similar methods as FPM. The fact that you can circumvent Google's reCaptcha with a "earn money online" service scheme makes Google look bad. Pokemon Go is going to make the web more secure by forcing Google to make its security solutions better. Banking and online payment services should lead that charge and not a game.

Smanny As far as why they made the Pixel with a big chin is exactly for symmetry. You guys didn’t even mention anything about the Pixels Daydream VR. It has to sit in a VR headset, so the screen has to be in the middle, and the headset needs to hold onto something. Plus Samsung has their own Gear VR and they are partnered with Oculus. Google started the whole mobile VR back in 2013 with their Cardboard. They needed someone to showcase their Daydream VR. So that is what the Pixel is exactly doing. Not to mention showcase their new camera software which uses the same VR sensors for image stabilization. They are using the fastest gyroscope and accelerometer sensors on any smartphone. A tech blog was saying that they can acquire 200 samples per second, which brings down latency and improves image stabilization, plus those sensors help out in VR as well. This time Google had to take the matters into their own hands. Because the software needed to have specific hardware, cpu, gpu, and sensors as well. Does anyone think that Google honestly wants to see any fragmentation. Absolutely not. You have to remember that if an OEM keeps updating a device for the next 5 years. They they will be loosing money, especially if you only paid $200 for a device (purchased outright). Mawhayden Interest in the Phone not the VR, VR will come 1st to the home,VR mobile is it really ready…maybe in5 years but not now. Smanny It certainly won’t be 5 years from now. VR is here today, and especially in mobile. The mobile processors today already can handle VR. From games to education, to movies, and videos. For instance the PS VR can and does already work perfectly for two displays (TV and VR headset). The mobile versions only needs to worry about feeding one display, only. The reason why the newer PS/4 is going to be 4 teraflops is so it can support multiple VR headsets simultaneously. Mobile devices (smartphones) will never have to worry about driving more than one display. Mawhayden Nah, I will pass, I will leave those toys to the “Younglings, I will choose 5G Technologies, Fibre Tech, advanced materials and advanced Mesh Networks, I willleave VR to you,you are more interested in this than I am have fun though. Not for you Nice to hear a discussion about the impacts on new services due to the lack of diversity amongst those who build them.

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau By Jessica Toonkel and Julia Love Google's new "Pixel" smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics(005930.KS) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O). Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc's(GOOGL.O) Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's Oct 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

In its place, the company will instead include Duo, its recently released FaceTime competitor for instant video chatting. Hangouts isn't totally going away. It will remain an optional member of the Google Mobile Services package, which Google requires manufacturers to install so consumers have integral services like the Chrome browser and Google Maps. However, the demotion means Hangouts will have significantly less visibility among new phone buyers if companies do decide to leave it out. This does not mean manufacturers will decide to leave Hangouts wallowing in the Play Store. The app could very well make its way onto Android handsets for many months to come. And the app will be available for download even if it is left out of the GMS suite — that is until Google decides to shutter it. Still, the move is a telling one from the search giant, which has moved aggressively to promote Duo and its new artificial intelligence-powered chat app Allo. It's a bit of a strange move that Allo won't be a mandatory app in the GMS suite, as Android Police points out, but it could be included down the line. Right now, it's clear Google wants to promote video chatting above all else.

First, the recoveries have started and Google confirmed it should be done fairly soon, probably next few days. The recoveries thus far look very impressive. Early on, our polls showed that the recoveries were not but that has changed. Google says you should keep on using the disavow file even though Google devalues with Penguin versus demotes. Google paid $100,000 for a link from Apache.org, nah but still funny. Google said negative SEO still not a concern for them. Google said directories are not the right way to build links. Google said 301 redirecting all your old pages to your home page will result in them being a soft 404. Google showed off the Google Home and Assistant and how they handle featured snippets is way cool. Most SEOs want an intrusive ad interstitial penalty tool from Google. Google is testing an advanced verification method for Google My Business. Google is displaying more images in the mobile results. Google AdWords updated their mobile apps.

There are just two main problems: Wiz doesn’t seem to know a dang thing You’re then asked to “buy” a monthly package for better support No thanks, Drippler! If you miss Drippler’s curated Android news, try downloading EarlyBird – News for Android. And if you’re looking for tech support for your phone and apps/games (without paying monthly for a hipster chatbot), download Channels – Forums for Android. Both apps are owned by our parent company, Neverstill Media. We have been fans of Drippler in the past, but the latest update showcases a few dangerous moves any tech company can make. Blindly Chasing Trends At the Google Pixel event, Sundar Pichai said that the future has moved from “mobile” to “artificial intelligence”, a way to explain the company’s love affair with their new product- Google Assistant. Drippler’s “Tech Assistant” feels like a carbon copy knockoff, personalized with a cartoony mascot to make it seem like you’re talking to an actual entity. The problem? Google is home to the world’s largest treasure chest of information, has the largest and smartest team of engineers to systematically unlock that information, and even Google’s product feels somewhat elementary. Ask “Giz” almost anything and you feel like you’re talking to a wall. This achieves the opposite of the intended effect… but it gets worse. Following the money It seems Drippler already had a solid monetization strategy, infusing tech-focused sponsored stories into their news feed. They were non-intrusive, fit the theme of the app, jived with the interest of readers, and seemed to work well. Management and angel investors must not have liked the results, seeking additional revenue in the form of premium monthly subscriptions. That’s a great idea and potentially lucrative idea, in theory, but Drippler messed up by pushing the new feature too hard, too fast. Over Promise, Under Deliver You know the old adage, “Under promise, over deliver,” right? The new Drippler does just the opposite. You’re introduced to the app with a wonderfully simple onboarding process that claims the app will fulfill all your tech needs, but when you start asking questions, you’re pushed to a sales pitch every. single. time. Update: it seems Drippler has temporarily buried the option for Premium Subscriptions due to extremely negative feedback, including a flood of 1-star Google Play Store Reviews and articles like this. Most successful subscription services work because the user gets something free and enjoys it so much, they want more and are willing to pay for it. In Drippler’s case, the subscription is shrouded in the uncertainty of a self-proclaimed groundbreaking digital genius-bot who seems to know nothing, so for what exactly are you paying? Nobody knows… and so nobody will. The Alternatives We hope Drippler returns to their trusty blue driplet, but until/unless they do, you may be looking for a go to source for Android News and Android Help. Thankfully, we’ve been working hard on 2 new apps that deliver these specific solutions. Android News – (EarlyBird) This app is like the Tinder of Android News, with community voting to create a trending news list, and the ability to follow specific topics and get notifications for any related updates. It’s been getting continually high praise on the Google Play Store and shows no signs of slowing down. Download EarlyBird Android Help – Channels This app will automatically detect your phone and the apps and games you’ve got on it, creating discussion forums for each so you can have conversations with like-minded device owners and users. Start conversations, get notifications of replies, and get the most out of Android through 1-on-1 discussions about everything from support and troubleshooting, to tips and tricks, to product and accessory reviews and suggestions. Download ChannelsWe hope you enjoy these two apps and Drippler team – if you’re listening – please drop the Tech Assistant and return to your roots!

According to new indexes from Fiksu DSP, a mobile marketing company, ad costs on Android devices have more than doubled since 2015, steadily growing year over year. Marketers have become more willing to pay per user as Android's platform becomes more popular. Android's growth is inching the mobile platform closer to iOS, but Apple is still the lead market for ad buys, as Google's operating system hasn't reached the same level of mass popularity as iOS has -- yet. Apple did not immediately return requests for comment. Google declined to comment. Despite the competition in pricing, a majority of mobile ads tend to run on both Android and iOS. Google hopes that its latest Pixel and Pixel XL phones will help Android take on Apple, as the two companies battle for mobile supremacy. "From last year to now, it's evident that both operating systems are experiencing changes that are largely a function of maturity," Tom Cummings, a vice president of new market development at Fiksu DSP said.

By Conner Forrest | October 7, 2016, 8:23 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: James Martin/CNET The next generation of computing, according to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, will be marked by a shift from "mobile-first to AI-first." For Google, that shift will be built upon its AI-powered intelligent assistant, Google Assistant. The launch of this software has implications for individual users, but it also signifies a new strategy by Google to connect many of its businesses together with a common thread. To help Android users, AI fans, and enterprise decision-makers understand the features of Google Assistant, and why it matters, we've put together the most important details and resources in this smart person's guide. This is a "living" article that will be updated and refreshed as new, relevant information becomes public. SEE: Check out all of TechRepublic's smart person's guides Executive summary (TL;DR) What it is: Google Assistant is a conversational, voice-activated digital assistant created by Google that can perform actions on behalf of a user and provide contextual information. Why it matters: Google Assistant is important because it is the linchpin in Google's AI-first strategy for the future, and will likely come to define how users interact with almost all of Google's core products. Who does it affect: Consumers who are invested in the Google ecosystem will be affected by this, as will other smartphone manufacturers who may be prompted to create or acquire their own competing AI product. When is this happening: Google Assistant was first unveiled at the 2016 Google I/O developer conference in May 2016, and it will be first available on some products in fall 2016. It will likely come to more devices and platforms in the future. How to take advantage of Google Assistant: Currently, Google Assistant will be exclusive to the Google Pixel phone in terms of smartphones, but it also being previewed as part of Google's smart chat app, Allo, and will also integrate with Google Home. What it is Google Assistant is a voice-activated personal digital assistant, first introduced by Google at the 2016 I/O conference in California. Much like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, or Microsoft's Cortana, the Google Assistant provides contextual information and performs actions such as booking a restaurant reservation or sending a message on behalf of the user.

To perform its functions, Google Assistant relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning to understand what the user is saying, and to make suggestions or act on that language input. Google Assistant is the foundational piece of Google's "AI-first" strategy that CEO Sundar Pichai recently discussed at a Made by Google event. Before Google Assistant, Google created another digital assistant software known as Google Now. And, while Google Now is still in operation, there are some subtle differences between the two platforms. Google Now operates within an app available on Android or iOS, while Google Assistant is currently exclusive to certain products like Google Allo and the Google Pixel phone. As CNET's Sarah Jacobsson Purewal pointed out, Google Assistant can perform all of the actions that Google Now can, but it is more conversational and uses a deeper level of AI. The goal of Google Assistant, Pichai previously said, is to "build a personal Google for each and every user." Google Assistant will eventually be the connective tissue among all of Google's core software and hardware products.

As noted above, Google believes that, just as the tech world moved from web to mobile, the next stage in that evolution is to move from mobile to AI. As hardware becomes more commoditized, smartphone manufacturers must compete on what they can provide through next-generation software and AI. Not only that, but they also must build out an ecosystem of products and devices that share access to this AI. Google Assistant will be embedded in the new Google Pixel phone, but it also works in its smart chat app, Allo, and is a key part of its smart home hub, Google Home. Other companies are following a similar trajectory. Samsung recently purchased Viv Labs and plans on embedding conversational interfaces in its devices and home appliances. Microsoft put Cortana in the Xbox One, and Apple is working on integrating Siri into more of its products as well.

(ZDNet) Google's spruced-up digital assistant wants to chat you up (CNET) Who does this affect? The advent of Google Assistant, first and foremost, affects consumers in the Google ecosystems. Smartphone users who purchase a Pixel phone, or smart home fans who install a Google Home hub, will be able to use Google Assistant to stay more connected and automate many parts of their daily lives. Developers will also be affected by Google Assistant, as it opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for AI-powered services. In fact, Google announced that it will be releasing an Embedded Google Assistant SDK, aimed at hardware vendors and developers who can find new integrations for the technology. Other smart home product manufacturers will also be affected by Google Assistant, as it adds another major player to the market.

The launch of this software has implications for individual users, but it also signifies a new strategy by Google to connect many of its businesses together with a common thread. To help Android users, AI fans, and enterprise decision-makers understand the features of Google Assistant, and why it matters, we've put together the most important details and resources in this smart person's guide. This is a "living" article that will be updated and refreshed as new, relevant information becomes public. SEE: Check out all of TechRepublic's smart person's guides Executive summary (TL;DR) What it is: Google Assistant is a conversational, voice-activated digital assistant created by Google that can perform actions on behalf of a user and provide contextual information. Why it matters: Google Assistant is important because it is the linchpin in Google's AI-first strategy for the future, and will likely come to define how users interact with almost all of Google's core products. Who does it affect: Consumers who are invested in the Google ecosystem will be affected by this, as will other smartphone manufacturers who may be prompted to create or acquire their own competing AI product. When is this happening: Google Assistant was first unveiled at the 2016 Google I/O developer conference in May 2016, and it will be first available on some products in fall 2016. It will likely come to more devices and platforms in the future. How to take advantage of Google Assistant: Currently, Google Assistant will be exclusive to the Google Pixel phone in terms of smartphones, but it also being previewed as part of Google's smart chat app, Allo, and will also integrate with Google Home. What it is Google Assistant is a voice-activated personal digital assistant, first introduced by Google at the 2016 I/O conference in California. Much like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, or Microsoft's Cortana, the Google Assistant provides contextual information and performs actions such as booking a restaurant reservation or sending a message on behalf of the user.

To perform its functions, Google Assistant relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language processing and machine learning to understand what the user is saying, and to make suggestions or act on that language input. Google Assistant is the foundational piece of Google's "AI-first" strategy that CEO Sundar Pichai recently discussed at a Made by Google event. Before Google Assistant, Google created another digital assistant software known as Google Now. And, while Google Now is still in operation, there are some subtle differences between the two platforms. Google Now operates within an app available on Android or iOS, while Google Assistant is currently exclusive to certain products like Google Allo and the Google Pixel phone. As CNET's Sarah Jacobsson Purewal pointed out, Google Assistant can perform all of the actions that Google Now can, but it is more conversational and uses a deeper level of AI. The goal of Google Assistant, Pichai previously said, is to "build a personal Google for each and every user." Google Assistant will eventually be the connective tissue among all of Google's core software and hardware products.

As noted above, Google believes that, just as the tech world moved from web to mobile, the next stage in that evolution is to move from mobile to AI. As hardware becomes more commoditized, smartphone manufacturers must compete on what they can provide through next-generation software and AI. Not only that, but they also must build out an ecosystem of products and devices that share access to this AI. Google Assistant will be embedded in the new Google Pixel phone, but it also works in its smart chat app, Allo, and is a key part of its smart home hub, Google Home. Other companies are following a similar trajectory. Samsung recently purchased Viv Labs and plans on embedding conversational interfaces in its devices and home appliances. Microsoft put Cortana in the Xbox One, and Apple is working on integrating Siri into more of its products as well.

(ZDNet) Google's spruced-up digital assistant wants to chat you up (CNET) Who does this affect? The advent of Google Assistant, first and foremost, affects consumers in the Google ecosystems. Smartphone users who purchase a Pixel phone, or smart home fans who install a Google Home hub, will be able to use Google Assistant to stay more connected and automate many parts of their daily lives. Developers will also be affected by Google Assistant, as it opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for AI-powered services. In fact, Google announced that it will be releasing an Embedded Google Assistant SDK, aimed at hardware vendors and developers who can find new integrations for the technology. Other smart home product manufacturers will also be affected by Google Assistant, as it adds another major player to the market. Amazon Alexa, despite its strong lead with the Amazon Echo and Dot, will likely face major competition in home automation from Google Home as the ecosystem is built out.

SUBSCRIBE Exploring a newly granted Google patent around social signals Columnist Dave Davies takes a deep dive into a recently published Google patent for clues on how the search giant is thinking about social signals and search results. Dave Davies on October 7, 2016 at 11:41 am More Disclaimer: When discussing patents, it’s important to remember that simply filing a patent does not mean a technology is in use or will ever be used. It is simply a strong indication that an idea is being considered and likely tested. Every now and then, a patent comes across my radar that gets me excited, and one granted recently to Google fits that bill perfectly. We’re heard repeatedly from Google that social interactions are not a search ranking signal.  In fact, you can read a Tweet from Google’s Gary Illyes in response to the statement, “Some controversy over whether Google takes social into account for SEO …” His reply: @RicardoBlanco take a look at this video. https://t.co/zPKuZRNaoy The short version is, no, we don't@louisgray @PRNews @JohnMu — Gary Illyes (@methode) June 7, 2016 So the answer is “No,” right? Maybe, and here’s where it gets interesting. Understanding that the folks at Google tend to give answers that are technically correct but not always in the spirit of the question asked, we can hear what’s being said as, “Social is not taken into account as a direct signal when determining the rankings.” This is very different from not being a signal at all, for reasons we’ll illustrate shortly. Another aspect of Google search that we need to be constantly aware of is that RankBrain now applies to all queries. Essentially, this means that artificial intelligence (AI) is interpreting all queries to some degree. While at this time the AI implementation revolves more around using machine learning to understand the nature of the query (and likely type of content and format being sought), its rollout to all queries and the promotion of John Giannandrea to Head of Search at Google marks the push into AI control over larger portions of the Google algorithm. “Why does this matter?” you might ask. The answer is that once machine learning and AI influence sections of the ranking algorithm — and not just the query interpretation — there will forever be factors and functions and results that not even the engineers at Google can fully determine. The answers Google gives will no longer be based on an actually conclusive understanding of what’s going on, but rather a better-than-average guess — and the exact factors and their weights won’t be fully known. I mention these things to wrap context around the patent we’ll now discuss. Google was recently granted patent US 2016/0246789 A1 titled, “Searching Content Of Prominent Users In Social Networks.” If it sounds incredibly interesting, that’s because it is. Good! Let’s get started. To keep things clear, I’m going to go through some of the key points and sections of the patent. I’ll begin with what they’ve written and immediately follow that with my interpretation of what it means in real English, then discuss any implications for SEOs. The abstract The abstract of a patent is essentially the outline of what it covers. They wrote: Methods, systems, and appay will use this connection to add further weight to the searcher’s interests and social graph. Section 41 They wrote: Identified content associated with the user’s social graph can include, for example, content or posting to resources subscribed to by the user (e.g., particular blogs). The identified information can also include content generated by members of the user’s social graph. For example, members of a user’s social graph can generate content including, for example, local reviews (e.g., for restaurants or services), video reviews and ratings, product reviews, book reviews, blog comments, news comments, maps, public web annotations, public documents, streaming updates, photos and photo albums. What it means: In this section, we see the capability to augment search results not just based on what is shared or engaged with by members of a searcher’s social graph, but also what is created by them. They use examples such as restaurant reviews and long-form content like blogs and photos. Section 48 They wrote: In some implementations, the presentation and ranking of search results associated with the user’s social graph is adjusted by one or more factors including one or more social signals. For example, affinity can be used to determine whether to show content from a particular member of the user’s social graph or whether to promote or demote the member’s ranking. Affinity identifies the closeness of a member to the user. For example, a friend of a friend who has five common middle friends with the user has a higher affinity than a friend of a friend who has only one common middle friend. What it means: Here we learn that the patent includes the ability to assign affinity values to the relationship between a searcher and a prominent user. This is to say, the more friends they have in common, the higher the affinity score and the more likely their content would be to impact the other’s search results. Section 51 While everything above has been very interesting, it’s in section 51 that we start to see the full impact. They wrote: … when interleaving search results associated with the user’s social graph along with general search results, a promotion can be applied to the search results associated with the user’s social graph in order to increase their visibility. For example, the ranking of search results associated with the user’s friends is often lower than a general wide-spread result. Thus, promotion of search results associated with the user’s social graph can prevent them from being buried by general search results. What it means: Here’s where we read the actual intent, and it’s in the line, “promotion of search results associated with the user’s social graph can prevent them from being buried by general search results.” Where traditionally, certain web pages may not naturally rank highly, they would be promoted to higher positions if prominent members of a searcher’s social graph have engaged with them. Section 52 They wrote: The boosting factor could be based on, for example, the number of friends who endorsed the identified resource or a top affinity to a friend who endorsed the identified resource. Boosting can also be based on authorship (e.g., what is the relationship or affinity with the individual that endorsed the resource), or the type of endorsement did the member of the user’s social graph provide (e.g., an explicit endorsement by starring a result or page or an implicit endorsement by visiting the resource or commenting on a posting). What it means: Where section 51 covered that resources can be boosted based on how one’s social graph interacts with it, in section 52 we get a few more specifics regarding possible methods. For example, they discuss boosting a resource based on the searcher’s relationship with the author or person that endorsed the resource and the type of endorsement (which seems to add more weight to types that require a great engagement and commitment of time). Section 55 They wrote: The search results can be presented to the user, e.g., as a search results page, that includes one or more of the general search results and the search results associated with the user’s social graph. The search results can be presented with separate portions displaying general search results and social graph results … What it means: In section 55, we read how the search engine results page may include a separate section for content boosted from the searcher’s social graph, or those results may be mixed in with the general search results. Section 61 They wrote: … a user can be categorized as a prominent user based on a number of contacts that the user has within one or more computer-implemented services, a number of resources distributed by the user as an author user through one or more computer-implemented services, and/or traffic generated by the user within one or more computer-implemented services. In some examples, traffic can be determined based on a number of resources distributed by the author user and a number of follower users that follow the user within the one or more computer-implemented services (discussed in further detail below). In some examples, a prominent user can include a user having a number of asymmetric contacts within the one or more computer-implemented services that exceeds a threshold number of asymmetric contacts. By way of example, the author user can include a famous user (e.g., a well-known blogger, a celebrity, a professional athlete, a head of state, etc.) that has a significant number of asymmetric contacts … What it means: Here we read how prominent users may be ranked. Prominent users may be selected or prioritized based on a wide array of factors, including the number of people they influence, the amount of traffic they generate, the number of non-reciprocal connections they have and whether they are famous, as well as a host of other possible criteria. Section 66 They wrote: If the user interacts with content distributed by a second prominent user less often, a second affinity score between the user and the second prominent user can be associated with a second value … What it means: As always Google allows for on-the-fly adjustments based on user behavior. In this section, they cover the issue of promoting content from a prominent user in one’s social graph where the boost is not interesting to one in the search environment. Consider a scenario where one of your relatives with whom you communicate regularly via social media or email has their content boosted for your queries.  If you are looking up election information, and their political views are diametrically opposed to your own, this would not be at all useful. You may like them, you may engage with them often, but that doesn’t make them relevant to your everyday search experience. Conclusion So you’ve made it this far, congratulations! Only a few more points to go.  Let’s boil down what this patent includes: A searcher can have a social graph associated with them. This social graph can be created by accessing their social connections including social media sites, blogs, email and chat functions and so on. When Google can make a connection between a users’ persona on one property and another, they will to create a fuller picture of their social graph and connections. Members of a searcher’s social graph can be ranked based on how close they are to the searcher, how many shared connections they have, how popular they are globally, how often the searcher and that user engage with each other and so on. Resources by or recommended by a member of one’s social graph can be boosted into a higher search engine result for a query based on the searcher’s association with the user recommending said resource. If a searcher doesn’t engage with the recommended resources of a specific users consistently, that user’s recommendations may be devalued In short, according to this patent, the things that people you’re connected to recommend, like and engage with could be used to impact your rankings. While I haven’t yet seen any direct evhdence of this at this time, it makes sense, and Google has toyed with similar systems in the past. The idea of boosting a restaurant that a friend of mine likes who lives in a city I’m visiting would have easily perceived advantages. Similarly, showing me the news sites my friends are referencing on Facebook when I search for election information also makes sense, knowing that my political views are more likely to be aligned with the majority of my connections. There are a significant number of advantages to a system like this, and because its foundation is based on engagement, it isn’t easily gamed. I’m pretty sure we’re going to see this type of augmentation of the general search results in the near future taking personalization to the next level. And so continues the journey down the long road of personalized results, where now not only will you need a strong site with great content, you need the friends of your prospective clients to engage with it.

SUBSCRIBE Results from the Local SEO Ranking Factors Study presented at SMX East Wonder what factors correlate with strong local rankings? Contributor Christine Churchill summarizes the results of a recent local ranking factors study presented at SMX East 2016. Christine Churchill on October 7, 2016 at 10:54 am More The SMX East Session “The 2016 Quantitative Local SEO Ranking Factors Study” presented by Local SEO Guide‘s Dan Leibson (Vice President of Local & Product) and Andrew Shotland (President) explored the results of their recent study analyzing and prioritizing ranking factors that affect local search. Unlike many studies that simply summarize search marketing experts’ opinions, the Local SEO Guide study took actual quantitative data as input. Leibson and Shotland teamed with competitive intelligence tool maker Places Scout and statisticians from the University of California, Irvine. By partnering with the University’s Center for Statistical Consulting, they ensured theestudy results were independent and withstood objective statistical analysis. Their presentation, entitled “Reverse Engineering Google’s Local Search Algorithm,” highlighted the main findings of their study. It is important to remember that the results of the study reveal correlations, not causations. The study identified characteristics of sites that ranked well; it does not definitively say these characteristics are ranking factors. The study assembled data from over 100 different ranking factors, 30,000 businesses and 3,000 local searches. Factors analyzed in the study included Google My Business listings, on-site website factors, off-site local factors (including citations) and links. Industry standard link tools Majestic and Moz were used for collecting link metrics. (For more details on the methodology used, visit Local Search Ranking Factors Study on the Local SEO Guide website.) Factors Analyzed in Local Search Study The goal of the study was to identify factors that mattered in Google Local 3-Pack and Maps search so that business owners could have actionable data showing what to allocate resources and efforts towards with the goal of improving their local search performance. The results proved that to succeed in local search, the online marketer needs to pay attention to areas not normally considered in local search — namely, links and website optimization. Ordinal and categorical variables The study segmented the ranking factors into Ordinal and Categorical variables. Ordinal Variables were numeric based factors, and sites with higher values for these factors ranked higher. Categorical Variables were Yes/No — if a business had this top-rated characteristic, it tended to rank higher. Ordinal variables included in the study The chart below shows the factors included as Categorical variables (usually a yes/no test) for various ranking factors, again ranked by perceived weight. Categorical factors Many of these factors fall into “foundational SEO” or “foundational Google My Business” factors, which are basic best practices and under the site owner’s control. For example, Google My Business factors like having an Owner Verified (OV) listing or including business hours and photos are easy to do, and these factors will differentiate your site from those who don’t take these basic steps. The takeaway here was that it’s worthwhile to allocate time to build out a robust Google My Business profile. Reviews matter Two Google My Business (GMB) factors topped the list: reviews and profile views (though the latter is more a correlation than a factor — top pages get more views rather than the other way around). Google reviews came in at the top of the list. The sites with the most reviews outranked other businesses. It may be that sites with more reviews get more clicks, but the fact that sites with more reviews ranked at the top is a strong indication that local companies should ensure they have reviews. Another GMB factor was the presence of photos. This factor came in at the eighth position, followed closely by having an owner verified profile and including business hours. Again, taking the time to build out a quality GMB profile is seen as positive. Moving towards traditional organic factors The results of the study confirmed what many in the local search field have suspected: namely, that Google is moving more toward using traditional organic algorithm ranking factors and applying them to local search. Activities that benefit organic SEO also benefit local search. Links, in particular, proved to be a large factor in local search, with various link metrics taking 10 of the top 15 ranking factors. Links have long been considered a major ranking factor in regular organic search. Going forward, local businesses need to pay attention to their linkage data just as in regular search. Other actions that are recommended for organic SEO should also be applied to local SEO. Having a secure site, using keywords in backlink anchor text, and having keywords in the title were shown to be characteristics of sites ranking well in the study. Keywords in the business name showed up as a strong positive factor. It is not suggested that you abuse this, but if you are starting a new business, this might be something to keep in mind. Having a mobile-friendly site came in as the third highest Categorical factor, emphasizing that Google’s shift toward favoring mobile-friendly sites is universal. Google has been saying mobile is a ranking factor in regular organic search, and it appears to help local as well, although sites which are mobile friendly have often had numerous other optimizations done. “Near me” queries In this session, Leibson also presented new results for “near me” type queries. The core takeaway on the “near me” queries is that the anchor text profile of links is important for ranking for those types of queries. Having both a higher raw number and a higher percentage of backlinks with [city] in anchor text, and [city/state] in anchor text correlated with positive pack rankings for “near me” queries, much more so than those same signals showed for non-“near me” local searches.

Chart showing where to invest your time in local search Since traditional SEO best practices were included in the characteristics of ranking sites, local businesses might want to ensure that they allot time to improve their website if they want to stay competitive in local search. The study revealed that local businesses need to go beyond just doing GMB and local citations in a vacuum. They still need to do normal local search work like gathering reviews, developing a robust local profile and citation building, but these are prerequisites. Webmasters need to do all the local work plus traditional SEO. The true value of this study is that it brings quantitative data to an area that has long been dominated by opinions. The results give marketers insights on where to place emphasis and allocate resources in their optimization efforts. Local Search Guide plans to repeat the study next year. It will be interesting to see how factors change as Google moves more toward more artificial intelligence influencing the ranking algorithm.

Factors Analyzed in Local Search Study The goal of the study was to identify factors that mattered in Google Local 3-Pack and Maps search so that business owners could have actionable data showing what to allocate resources and efforts towards with the goal of improving their local search performance. The results proved that to succeed in local search, the online marketer needs to pay attention to areas not normally considered in local search — namely, links and website optimization. Ordinal and categorical variables The study segmented the ranking factors into Ordinal and Categorical variables. Ordinal Variables were numeric based factors, and sites with higher values for these factors ranked higher. Categorical Variables were Yes/No — if a business had this top-rated characteristic, it tended to rank higher. Ordinal variables included in the study The chart below shows the factors included as Categorical variables (usually a yes/no test) for various ranking factors, again ranked by perceived weight. Categorical factors Many of these factors fall into “foundational SEO” or “foundational Google My Business” factors, which are basic best practices and under the site owner’s control. For example, Google My Business factors like having an Owner Verified (OV) listing or including business hours and photos are easy to do, and these factors will differentiate your site from those who don’t take these basic steps. The takeaway here was that it’s worthwhile to allocate time to build out a robust Google My Business profile. Reviews matter Two Google My Business (GMB) factors topped the list: reviews and profile views (though the latter is more a correlation than a factor — top pages get more views rather than the other way around). Google reviews came in at the top of the list. The sites with the most reviews outranked other businesses. It may be that sites with more reviews get more clicks, but the fact that sites with more reviews ranked at the top is a strong indication that local companies should ensure they have reviews. Another GMB factor was the presence of photos. This factor came in at the eighth position, followed closely by having an owner verified profile and including business hours. Again, taking the time to build out a quality GMB profile is seen as positive. Moving towards traditional organic factors The results of the study confirmed what many in the local search field have suspected: namely, that Google is moving more toward using traditional organic algorithm ranking factors and applying them to local search. Activities that benefit organic SEO also benefit local search. Links, in particular, proved to be a large factor in local search, with various link metrics taking 10 of the top 15 ranking factors. Links have long been considered a major ranking factor in regular organic search. Going forward, local businesses need to pay attention to their linkage data just as in regular search. Other actions that are recommended for organic SEO should also be applied to local SEO. Having a secure site, using keywords in backlink anchor text, and having keywords in the title were shown to be characteristics of sites ranking well in the study. Keywords in the business name showed up as a strong positive factor. It is not suggested that you abuse this, but if you are starting a new business, this might be something to keep in mind. Having a mobile-friendly site came in as the third highest Categorical factor, emphasizing that Google’s shift toward favoring mobile-friendly sites is universal.

They’ll pay you to show ads to people who watch your videos or visit your website. You can also pay them to show your ads to people, and it can quickly cost you thousands of dollars. That’s why you need to be really, really careful when you’re playing around in AdSense and AdWords. One pays you to use it, the other expects you to pay when you use it. Which is which? Well, apparently it’s all a bit confusing… especially if you’re a 12-year-old musician who’s trying to keep your feet on the ground while reaching for the stars. With dreams of adoring fans screaming while he and his band mates in Los Salerosos rolled through the gate to his mansion, 12-year-old Jose Javier signed up to make a few bucks off his band’s YouTube videos. He linked up his savings account and waited for the clicks to start rolling in. That they did, but not in the way he’d hoped. Somewhere along the line he confused Google’s products, and he wound up building an ad campaign in AdWords. Instead of seeing commissions piling up in his ledger, Google was sending him invoices. The initial €15 didn’t raise any eyebrows, but when the bank saw an account with a €2,000 balance pinged with charges that had risen to nearly €20,000 they immediately contacted Jose’s parents. By this point, the total on his AdWords account had rocketed to €120,000. His mother told reporters that it was a honest mistake, and that Jose didn’t even see what the big deal was. Maybe that’s because he knew that Google doesn’t enter into binding agreements with 12-year-olds and that they’d ultimately agree to wipe the slate clean. Google did just that, and wouldn’t you know it? Tons of free publicity for Los Salerosos. Well done, Jose! Accident or not, you not only escaped unscathed from a six-figure advertising bill but you also introduced the entire Internet to your band.
