Mr Sheikh manages the JPMorgan Global Income Fund, among others. The fund aims to provide regular income (monthly or quarterly) by investing globally across a variety of asset classes, including high-yield bonds and high-dividend-yielding equities, real estate investment trusts (Reits), investment-grade corporate bonds and emerging market debt. Launched in 2008, the JPMorgan Global Income Fund A (div) - EUR had generated an annualised return of 8.6 per cent as of March 31. Launched in 2013, the A (mth) - SGD (hedged) class delivered a 3.9 per cent annualised return as of March 31. The historical annualised dividend yield for the A (mth) - SGD (hedged) share class was above 5 per cent last year. Q What is your strategy against a backdrop of rising interest rates? A With market sentiment firmly focused on broadening global growth and inflation, we are becoming more positive about equity, with a preference for developed markets over emerging markets. In terms of portfolio mix, Mr Talib Sheikh aims for a diversified blend of securities that can offer reliable income, rather than simply picking those with the highest yield. He feels political risks will be a key factor this year. ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIM Within the high-yield range, which are higher coupon paying bonds with a lower credit rating than investment-grade corporate bonds, we believe the current yield on offer remains a strong income opportunity in the current environment, even after taking into account the higher risks associated with such assets. We are maintaining our opportunistic allocations to preferred equity, which has a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stock, and non-agency mortgages issued by private financial institutions or other entities not guaranteed by the government. Q How is your approach to investing for income different? A We are finding opportunities globally to address the income challenge. We have access to both traditional, well-known asset classes, such as equity income and bonds, and areas that many investors might find hard to access. We look for a diversified mix of securities that can offer reliable income, rather than simply picking those with the highest yield. FURTHER STIMULUS EXPECTED The political surprises of 2016 have given governments a clear mandate to reflate or stimulate growth in their economies and address inequality. Investors expect significant fiscal stimulus and a continued move away from the reliance on monetary policy to reinvigorate economies. '' MR TALIB SHEIKH The key to generating a sustainable income stream isn't simply to pursue the highest-yielding investments in the absence of considering risk and volatility. It's combining the most attractive risk-adjusted income sources into a global multi-asset income portfolio that pursues the returns that investors need through diversification. Our investment universe spans a diversified opportunity set of global bonds and equities, Reits and other asset classes on an opportunistic basis, which enables the portfolio to be broadly diversified by both sector and geography. We research new opportunities and strategies that can be incorporated into the fund as conditions change. Q Does the fund look at benchmarks for its performance? A The primary focus of the strategy is to provide an optimum risk-adjusted yield with a risk profile similar to that of the benchmark. Thus, we have no performance objective against the benchmark, but we use it as a means of measuring risk and to give an indication of the types of asset classes that we would expect to invest in. In addition, our asset allocation is not driven in a benchmark-relative fashion. We aim to deliver a risk-return profile similar to that of a traditional 60:40 equity-to-fixed income balanced portfolio, but achieve this with a significantly higher yield component and diversification. Q Is it more challenging now to find diversified sources of income, given how quickly the global political and economic landscape is changing? A We have entered an era of rate normalisation. United States President Donald Trump's victory has raised expectations of fiscal stimulus and stronger American growth. With the risk of deflation receding, the lows of bond yields are behind us. However, we do not expect rates to reach pre-crisis levels, and income will remain a key factor for investors and a major component of total returns for many portfolios for the foreseeable future. Q Are all income-paying assets going to suffer in an environment where interest rates go up? A The structural drivers of low yields remain - depressed productivity, anaemic growth in the labour force and demographics. It is therefore unlikely that there will be a significant uplift in yields over the short to medium term. However, rates will see some upward pressure as a result of policy in the US and signs of inflation globally. There is often the misconception that a rising rate environment can be negative for all income-paying asset classes. Actually, this environment can present a range of opportunities for income investors who have the ability to take a multi-asset and dynamic approach. Historically, interest rate rises have not derailed equities as long as the increases came off a low base. An improving growth outlook should benefit corporate earnings and equity markets. In this environment, good-quality, dividend-paying equities look attractive. We have also significantly increased our exposure to financials, which look attractive on a valuation basis. While it is perfectly plausible that we have now entered a difficult period for bond investors as yields rise, the scale of the potential increase is key, as is flexibility. US high-yield instruments continue to look attractive, and we expect most issuers to maintain reasonable fundamentals. Alternative credit such as non-agency mortgages and preferred equity look attractive as they trade with minimal duration and currently pay an attractive yield. Q What does the "Trump trade" mean for income investors? A Mr Trump's election victory has suggested that his pro-growth business policies (less regulation, tax reform and higher fiscal spending) would significantly boost economic activity and finally spur inflation, not only in the US but globally as well. The political surprises of 2016 have given governments a clear mandate to reflate or stimulate growth in their economies and address inequality. Investors expect significant fiscal stimulus and a continued move away from the reliance on monetary policy to reinvigorate economies. Rising growth and reflation reinforce our positive view of stocks versus bonds. The correlation of equity and bond returns is likely to be less negative as nominal growth, which is not adjusted for inflation, accelerates and - this is key - central banks react to the change. Q What will be the biggest political surprise of 2017, and does it matter for multi-asset investors? A Political risks remain centre stage this year, with pivotal elections looming in the Netherlands, France and Germany. In the US, there remains policy uncertainty out of the White House. In terms of the portfolio, we have recently undertaken a meaningful tilt towards a reflationary environment of slightly higher growth and therefore more pro-risk. We are not making dramatic changes in strategy; it remains to be seen how political change will play out, but we could see more optimism around cyclical assets. In a broadly positive growth environment, we would reasonably expect stocks in general to outperform, so we are increasing our allocation to global and European equities at the margin. In Europe, we see a broad pickup in economic momentum, which in turn provides a lift for stocks. However, this is not necessarily evenly spread and, just as momentum in the euro zone is rising, we face a rollover in economics indicators in Britain as political and economic risks have yet to be discounted.

A total of 50 graduates received their certificates of completion from Bayan Academy for successfully completing 840 and 1,040 hours of classroom training in the 2D and 3D Animation NC III courses, respectively.  They also finished at least 120 hours of internship which included project immersion to further enhance their competencies, and test their attitude and workplace relationships. Of the 50 graduates, 47 already passed the TESDA assessment; while the remaining 3 are scheduled to take their tests. One of the scholars is 21-year old Pamela Ladrillo who is currently employed by a local animation studio. According to her, the training she received prepared her for the demands of the job. “I learned a lot from my training and while it is uncommon to find women animators, I’m confident that I can compete amongst the best in the industry. I am now a 3D animator but my employer -– impressed with my work –- saw my potential to do 3D modeling too,” Pamela said. For one of the grant beneficiaries, Marlon Rapsing, the course helped him fast-track his career in Animation. “The skills I’ve learned, plus the exposure and training I’ve received helped me deliver high-value creative services which made me stand out from the competition,” he said.  Graduates of 3D animation who are scholars of Bayan Academy and JP Morgan Chase Rapsing is now with Tycoon Animation, the fastest growing animation company in the Philippines, as a junior animator along with five former trainees. Sharing Rapsing’s success story are six other graduates of the program who are now 2D and 3D animators in Dreamlords Digital, a direct-to-digital studio based in Las Vegas and Manila, specializing in games and gamified apps. Another inspiring grantee is Marissa Cassica who left her previous work to pursue her passion. After finishing the program, she was accepted in September 2016 as an artist and production officer at SGNFX, an integrated in-house design and manufacturing company.  After three months, she was promoted to operations division head managing at least 20 people from different departments such as administration, purchasing, design, sales and production. “Through the program, I was able to improve my skills in lay outing, drawing, movement of figures, among others. The technopreneurship sessions helped me improve my management skills particularly in dealing with customers and my staff. As a breadwinner, the program also provided an opportunity for my family to improve our way of life,” she said. According to a study conducted by Bayan Academy, the scholars are mostly millennials who strive for recognition and are committed to improving their craft regardless of the amount of time required to complete the training.  Interestingly, 20 out of the 50 animation scholars are women; while 11 of the graduates are high school teachers. The participation of women in high-tech, high-impact industry such as this is a breakthrough and one that is highly-encouraged. Topics: Bayan Academy , JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Reuters reports that R3, which counts about 80 financial institutions as members, wants to raise $150 million from its members and strategic investors and give them a 60 percent stake in R3. "JPMorgan parted ways with R3 to pursue a very distinct technology path which is at odds with the one chosen by the global financial services industry, represented by our 80-plus members," said Charley Cooper, a managing director at R3. JPMorgan's move follows the departure of other large banks from the R3 consortium. Goldman Sachs, Banco Santander, Morgan Stanley and National Australian Bank left the group in quick succession in late 2016, as R3 proceeded with its fundraising plans.

Morgan Stanley's Q4 profit doubles on bond-trading surge Donald Trump and the history of the 'first 100 days' How Trump's first 100 days at White House have changed things in US Visa abuse, jobs, lobbying: Trump lays out his agenda for first 100 days President Donald Trump has given the $5.1-trillion-day currency market a shot in the arm. During his first 100 days in office, the US leader’s pronouncements on trade, taxes and foreign policy have tended to generate a burst of activity in the world’s biggest financial market. CLS Group Holdings, which settles more than $1 trillion of currency trades daily, crunched the numbers and found examples of at least five days in which the administration caused the volume of transactions to leap. “Irrespective of how successful President Trump is perceived to have been so far, he and his administration dominated news headlines during the first 100 days in office,” CLS said in a report released this week. “The impact on the FX market was indeed significant.” Market gyrations have been a boon for global investment banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup, which reported strong first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities. In one example of Trump’s impact on currency trading, average hourly volumes surged to $84 billion at 4 pm London time on January 31 after Trump and an adviser criticised US trading partners for having currencies that are too weak, CLS data show. That’s up from an average of below $50 billion for that period in 2016. Activity also surged as Trump promised a tax-reform plan in February, promoted his health-care bill in March and expressed concern about the dollar’s strength this month. The boost in short-term trading has coincided with a weaker greenback, which has almost wiped out its post-election gains. “With Trump’s approach to governance via Twitter, it’s no wonder that volatility has increased, and volumes as a result,” said Bipan Rai, senior foreign-exchange and macro strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. “Developed markets are still adjusting to political risk being priced into currencies.” Bloomberg Read More On 100 Days Of Trump | Donald Trump | Twitter | Fx Market | Morgan Stanley | Bank Of America | Jpmorgan Chase | International | Politics PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Cover from Natural Calamities.

The boost in short-term trading has coincided with a weaker greenback, which has almost wiped out its post-election gains. “With Trump’s approach to governance via Twitter, it’s no wonder that volatility has increased, and volumes as a result,” said Bipan Rai, senior foreign-exchange and macro strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. “Developed markets are still adjusting to political risk being priced into currencies.” Bloomberg Lananh Nguyen | Bloomberg Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 FX traders find Trump's first 100 days good for business Market gyrations have been a boon for global investment banks like Morgan Stanley & Bank of America President Donald Trump has given the $5.1-trillion-day currency market a shot in the arm. During his first 100 days in office, the US leader’s pronouncements on trade, taxes and foreign policy have tended to generate a burst of activity in the world’s biggest financial market. CLS Group Holdings, which settles more than $1 trillion of currency trades daily, crunched the numbers and found examples of at least five days in which the administration caused the volume of transactions to leap. “Irrespective of how successful President Trump is perceived to have been so far, he and his administration dominated news headlines during the first 100 days in office,” CLS said in a report released this week. “The impact on the FX market was indeed significant.” Market gyrations have been a boon for global investment banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup, which reported strong first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities. In one example of Trump’s impact on currency trading, average hourly volumes surged to $84 billion at 4 pm London time on January 31 after Trump and an adviser criticised US trading partners for having currencies that are too weak, CLS data show. That’s up from an average of below $50 billion for that period in 2016. Activity also surged as Trump promised a tax-reform plan in February, promoted his health-care bill in March and expressed concern about the dollar’s strength this month. The boost in short-term trading has coincided with a weaker greenback, which has almost wiped out its post-election gains. “With Trump’s approach to governance via Twitter, it’s no wonder that volatility has increased, and volumes as a result,” said Bipan Rai, senior foreign-exchange and macro strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. “Developed markets are still adjusting to political risk being priced into currencies.” Bloomberg Lananh Nguyen | Bloomberg Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 MORE ON MARKETS: Quick Links Stock Market Live Portfolio Commodity Market Upcoming IPO Personal Finance Stock Market News Derivatives Mutual Funds Gold Price Sensex Browse STOCK Companies A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Browse Mutual Funds A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Index Stocks ACC Adani Ports Ambuja Cem.

(AAPL) Earnings Should Answer Apple earnings won't move AAPL stock based on numbers, but the answers to a few key questions might By Vince Martin, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 29, 2017, 10:09 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: The 10 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy for $10 or Less General Electric Company (GE) Stock Has Lost Investors’ Trust Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Going to Burn Amid Flex 2 Explosion Report Recent Posts: 5 Questions Apple Inc. (AAPL) Earnings Should Answer Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Has More Upside to come Why the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Rally Isn’t Finished View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will release its second-quarter results on Tuesday. But unlike past reports, Apple earnings won’t be the center of attention — nor is it likely that the numbers alone will move AAPL stock. Source: Shutterstock Two different investment banks — JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and UBS Group AG (USA) (NYSE:UBS) — already have predicted Apple earnings and guidance could miss expectations. And yet both firms remain bullish on Apple stock. The logic behind the divergence is clear, and the market as a whole should take a similar view in valuing AAPL stock after Apple earnings. Apple’s new iPhone is on the way — and investors already are looking forward. The Q2 report isn’t going to be about Apple earnings — it’s going to be about the Apple earnings conference call. Apple stock holders have a lot of questions to ask — and it will be up to AAPL CEO Tim Cook to give the right answers. When’s That New iPhone Coming Out? The most anticipated question is whether Apple will give more detail on the next iPhone. Apple already is gaining market share ahead of the release later this year — but AAPL investors want more. It’s possible that announcements here — or the lack thereof — could move Apple stock. It’s starting to look as if supplier delays may push back the new iPhone’s release date. Samsung is reportedly struggling to supply OLED panels for the device, and contract manufacturers are behind schedule. A delay would push the release of the as-yet-unnamed new model toward Christmas – and that could unnerve investors in AAPL stock, at least in the short term. Is AAPL In the M&A Market? An analyst report in early April spurred rumors of an acquisition by Apple of Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). And while such a combination seems unlikely, it is clear that Apple at the least is considering a buyout of a size much larger than it has traditionally executed. Cook hinted at M&A on the Q1 conference call, saying “we are always looking at acquisitions…and we look for companies of all sizes, and there’s not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it.” Given the rumors of late, investors surely will be reading into any further comments to get a better read on Apple’s M&A ambitions. How’s the Services Business Doing? The one fundamental metric that may move Apple stock is its services revenue. Apple sales excluding the iPhone have been bizarrely consistent over the past five years, and the company simply hasn’t been able to drive any non-iPhone growth. The iPod faded, and was replaced by the iPad. It too has faded, offsetting growth in Apple Music and other initiatives. Cook has laid out a target to double services revenue – which might require some of the aforementioned M&A. And at some point, Apple needs real growth beyond the iPhone to increase the multiple of Apple earnings assigned to AAPL stock. As a result, investors will be watching that metric closely.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks You Can Keep Forever Investments that can stand the test of time are invaluable. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Apr 29, 2017 at 8:55AM The simplest investment you can make is to buy a stock that you'd be comfortable owning forever. Rather than keeping a tight rein on a stock and always being ready to pull the sell trigger, a long-term investment lets you pay attention to important trends that could define the future of a business years down the road. That's why choosing stocks with the idea of owning them indefinitely is such a valuable tool, and although Disney (NYSE:DIS), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) face plenty of risks in their businesses every day, they've already demonstrated their ability to survive tough periods and find new ways to thrive. Disney The company that began as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio has a history that dates back nearly a century, where two brothers worked on a series of combined live-action and animated films. From there, Disney has evolved into a multimedia empire, with its movie studio spurring the development of groundbreaking theme parks that are popular the world over. Television networks have expanded Disney's exposure, and retail outlets have taken full advantage of the House of Mouse's popularity to produce additional sales. The entertainment industry changes very quickly, and it can seem like an impossible task for one company to keep up. Yet Disney was early to realize that the most important commodity in entertainment was content, and it has worked hard with partners throughout the industry to make sure that it can acquire, produce, and distribute high-quality content in whatever way is most popular. From traditional cinemas to big-screen theaters, from cable television to streaming on mobile devices, Disney has shown an ability to roll with the times and keep offering the movies, shows, and experiences that people across the globe want to have. Image source: Disney. Starbucks Starbucks hasn't been around as long as Disney, but the Seattle-based company helped transform the way Americans drink coffee. Just like fast-food pioneers in the 1950s incorporated themselves into the way that people thought about eating, Starbucks saw the opportunity to bring the European coffeehouse concept to the U.S., and the thousands of locations that Starbucks now has both domestically and abroad are a testament to the success of its efforts. From its humble roots at Pike Place Market, Starbucks has legions of loyal customers willing to wait in long lines for their morning beverages. Along the way, Starbucks has found ways to overcome obstacles. Even during the 2008 recession, when it seemed as though small luxuries like $4 lattes might become a thing of the past, Starbucks showed its resiliency. Now, the company is attacking the higher end of the market, seeking to cater to ultra-premium customers with its Reserve Roastery concept. Despite plenty of competition, new entrants haven't been able to match Starbucks, and an almost fanatical devotion among its key customer base ensures that the coffee giant should see more years of growth ahead. JPMorgan Chase Financial institutions have been the backbone of American growth, and JPMorgan has operations that date back to the birth of the nation. John Pierpont Morgan was a key figure in the 19th and early 20th centuries, providing financing to railroads early in their history and helping to organize key industrial giants such as General Electric and U.S. Steel. The company that bears his name now encompasses both investment and retail banking operations, and JPMorgan Chase has retained and built on its status as one of Wall Street's most influential and important financial institutions in the world. The financial crisis did a good job of showing investors which banks were healthiest, and JPMorgan Chase did an unparalleled job of emerging from 2008's crisis in relatively strong condition. Faster than many of its peers, JPMorgan got itself back on track, and its stock now trades well in excess of the levels it enjoyed prior to the crisis. In an era in which banking regulation appears likely to wane in the years ahead, JPMorgan Chase will be in an even better position to take advantage of improving industry conditions and find new opportunities for growth worldwide. Few stocks have the staying power to be candidates to own forever. However, JPMorgan Chase, Starbucks, and Disney have already weathered plenty of storms, and they have potential growth opportunities that should keep them young at heart in the years to come.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 29 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Dow 30 Stock Roundup: 3M, DuPont, GE Beat; Coke Disappoints Shutterstock photo The index increased significantly over the week following strong gains during the first two trading sessions. The index surged on Monday following the victory of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the first round of the French presidential election. The index advanced by an identical margin on Tuesday, following the release of strong earnings reports and as expectation for possible tax reform grew. The Dow slipped on Wednesday following the release of Trump’s outline for tax reform and only managed to inch up on Thursday. Last Week’s Performance The Dow declined 0.2% last Friday, as investors remained concerned on the outcome of the Presidential election in France. The recent surge in popularity experienced by euroskeptic Jean-Luc Melenchon, had unnerved investors with many expressing concern over a possible „Frexit”. Frexit is likely to spark turmoil as France is considered to be an integral part of both the Eurozone and the European Union. Donald Trump’s encouraging comments on proposed tax reforms lifted investor sentiment, which helped to trim losses in the broader market. Meanwhile, existing-home sales in March increased to hit its highest pace in almost ten years. During last week, the index advanced 0.5%. Benchmarks gained last week following the release of strong earnings reports and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s comments on Trump’s proposed tax reform plans. However, retail sales fell in March for two consecutive months, posting their worst two-month stretch in two years due to weak demand in automobile sector. Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims dropped 49,000 to 1.98 million, indicating the strongest U.S. labor market in recent years. The Dow This Week The index surged 1.1% on Monday following the victory of centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the first round of the French presidential election. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM JPM and Goldman Sachs (GS) surged 3.5% and 2.9% respectively which boosted the Dow. Meanwhile, investors kept a close watch on quarterly earnings results with tech majors scheduled to report later in the week. The index advanced by 232.23 points, or 1.1% on Tuesday on Tuesday, following the release of strong earnings reports and as expectation for possible tax reform grew. Earnings for the Dow were particularly strong, with four of its five components exceeding expectations. The Nasdaq closed above 6,000 for the first time ever since its inception in 1971. Meanwhile, sales of newly-constructed homes in March increased 5.8% above its revised February rate. The index lost 0.1% on Wednesday following the release of Trump’s outline for tax reform. The plan promised to slash the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%. The new administration has also proposed to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15% along with an abolishment of the estate tax. Investors were disappointed as they had expected some more details about the tax-reform package. Meanwhile, market watchers kept a close watch on quarterly earnings results. The index inched up marginally on Thursday after technology shares experienced gains. Meanwhile, energy shares experienced a notable fall following concerns over increasing U.S. production and the restart of Libya’s big Sharara oil field upset oil market watchers. Lack of details in President Donald Trump’s tax plan unveiled on Wednesday also pared some gains for the broader market.

AP Who benefits from Trump's tax cuts? Apr 29, 2017 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS President Donald Trump speaks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on Thursday, April 6. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans’ financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass-through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here’s a closer look at Trump’s proposal and its likely impact: WHO BENEFITS? It’s hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. “The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown,” said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. “There’s not enough specificity. It’s hard for taxpayers to determine where they’ll come out.” Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes “especially for low- and middle-income families.” It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don’t itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that’s on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the U.S., which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. WHO’D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they’re structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump’s — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump’s proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Shobhana Chandra US GDP growth rose at a 0.7% annualized rate after advancing 2.1% in the prior quarter, commerce department data showed Friday in Washington. Photo: Richard Drew/AP Washington: The US economy expanded at the slowest pace in three years as weak auto sales and lower home-heating bills dragged down consumer spending, offsetting a pickup in investment led by housing and oil drilling. Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, rose at a 0.7% annualized rate after advancing 2.1% in the prior quarter, commerce department data showed Friday in Washington. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1% gain. Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, rose 0.3%, the worst performance since 2009. The GDP slowdown owes partly to transitory forces such as warm weather and volatility in inventories, which supports forecasts for a rebound as high confidence among companies and consumers and a solid job market underpin growth. Even so, the weakness at car dealers could weigh on expansion, and further gains in business investment could depend on the extent of policy support such as tax cuts. ALSO READ: Donald Trump’s shady tariffs will hurt US more than China “There’s reason to think that some of the things that were weak in the first quarter should reverse in the second quarter, in particular consumption and inventories,” Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said before the report. “Labour income is starting to pick up and actually keeping consumer spending pretty well supported.” The data are unlikely to dissuade Federal Reserve policy makers from raising interest rates in the coming months. Economists were largely expecting a weak growth figure, calling it a blip and not a sign of stagnation. Analysts have pointed to issues with the commerce department’s seasonal adjustment of growth data: Since 2000, expansion in the first quarter of each year has averaged 1%, compared with 2.2% for the rest of each year, according to Wells Fargo Securities. Trump’s target Though the first-quarter figure isn’t a verdict on President Donald Trump’s policies, economists are generally skeptical that growth will reach his goal of 3% to 4% on a sustained basis. Analysts’ estimates indicate just 2.2% to 2.3 annual growth through 2019, a tad above the average pace during the almost eight-year expansion. During the first quarter, a chief driver of growth was private, fixed non-residential investment, which contributed 1.12%age point to expansion, led by a record increase in mining exploration, shafts and wells, a category that includes oil structures. Residential investment added 0.5 point to growth. The change in inventories, one of the most volatile parts of the GDP calculation, subtracted 0.93 percentage point from growth, following a 1.01% gain. Trade, also volatile from quarter to quarter, contributed 0.07 point after a 1.82 point drag in the previous period. Economists’ forecasts for overall growth ranged from zero to 2.2%. The GDP estimate is the first of three for the quarter, with the other releases scheduled for May and June when more information becomes available. The 0.3% growth in household consumption, which accounts for about 70% of the economy, followed a 3.5% jump from October to December. The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey called for 0.9%, and purchases added 0.23 percentage point to first-quarter growth. While some of the slowdown may be temporary, inflation is eating into consumers’ wallets. Real disposable personal income rose at a 1% pace in the period, the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2013. Even though hiring has been humming along and the jobless rate of 4.5% is the lowest in almost a decade, a sustained pickup in wage growth would help boost consumers’ ability to spend. Business investment Non-residential fixed investment, or spending on equipment, structures and intellectual property, increased at a 9.4% annualized pace, the fastest since 2013. It grew at a 0.9% rate in the previous quarter. Among the details, equipment spending advanced 9.1%, a two-year high, while investment in non-residential structures, including office buildings and factories, surged 22.1% after dropping 1.9% in the prior quarter. Residential spending increased at a 13.7% annualized rate, the most since the second quarter of 2015, compared with the prior quarter’s advance of 9.6%. Trade added slightly to growth, as exports increased by more than imports during the quarter. Final sales to private domestic purchasers—which strip out government agencies, inventories and trade—rose at a 2.2% pace after a 3.4% advance. Government spending fared worse, decreasing 1.7% and taking away 0.3 percentage point from growth. State and local outlays fell at a 1.6% annualized rate, while spending by federal agencies dropped at a 1.9% pace. The report also showed price pressures were picking up. The GDP price index rose 2.3% in the first quarter. A measure of inflation tied to consumer spending and excluding volatile food and energy costs was up 2%, the fastest in four quarters.Bloomberg Shobhana Chandra Topics: US US GDP growth GDP growth rate Donald Trump US economy More From Livemint READ MORE Niti Aayog for simultaneous Lok Sabha, assembly polls from 2024 Presidential polls 2017: Opposition candidate will unite parties against BJP, says Sharad Yadav India eyes all-electric car fleet by 2030, says Piyush Goyal First Published: Fri, Apr 28 2017. 08 21 PM IST Editor's Picks RBI’s Viral Acharya calls for reprivatization of nationalized banks Tata-Docomo case: Delhi HC rejects RBI plea, clears $1.17 billion arbitration award Examining the China-North Korea oil arrangement and how it may not last Latest News Presidential polls 2017: Opposition candidate will unite parties against BJP, says Sharad Yadav India eyes all-electric car fleet by 2030, says Piyush Goyal Global pension funds scout for deals in India’s solar power sector Govt keen to push ahead with more PSB consolidation ASEAN gives Beijing a pass on South China Sea dispute, cites ‘improving cooperation’ Mint On Sunday The private lives of Delhi’s LGBT youth Getting Justin Bieber to India is very, very hard work 2003 World Cup final: If only India had chosen to bat first...

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 29, 2017 5:53pm   Comments Share: Ally Financial Inc (NYSE: ALLY), a notable player in the subprime auto loan market, warned investors its 2017 earnings per share will now grow less than previously expected. Ally Financial isn't alone in its outlook, as major banks are becoming hesitant in issuing new subprime loans suing money from their balance sheets. According to a Bloomberg report, Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) lowered the number of loans it made to subprime car buyers during the first quarter by 29 percent. Wells Fargo's decision wasn't a result of a damage to its reputation for its account opening scandal, rather it was a calculated move to tighten its standards. The bank also joins JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) whose consumer and community banking head Gordon Smith said earlier this year it is looking to "dramatically" lower its own subprime auto lending activity. Wells Fargo And JPMorgan Also Love Subprime Auto Loans? How is that banks are shying away from their subprime auto lending activity but at the same time supporting it in the face of concerning data. Bloomberg noted major banks are indirectly funding billions of dollars' worth of subprime auto loans by helping companies such as Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc (NYSE: SC) borrow cash in the asset-backed securities market. There may be some logic behind the seemingly confusing double-standard. Specifically, money managers including hedge funds tend to have a higher risk tolerance for riskier assets such as an auto subprime loan.

Majestic Realty Co. is living up to its name with a giant warehouse on its drawing board. Consider: The warehouse is the size of almost 13 football fields; It could store 10 Statute of Liberties; The amount of steel used to construct it could build 1,883 Priuses; The asphalt required could build a 20-foot wide road that stretches from downtown Denver to DIA; It will require enough concrete to build 1,504 driveways; And the dirt in the development could fill 2,453 swimming pools. As the Colorado Real Estate Journal reported a week ago, Majestic Realty Co. this June will start construction on a  701,500-square-foot warehouse in its Majestic Commercenter at Interstate 70 and Tower Road in Aurora. A map of the Majestic Commercenter in Aurora. The $30 million warehouse, with the nondescript name of Building 15, is anything but undistinguished, as it will be the single largest spec industrial building ever constructed in the Denver area. To put the size of the building in perspective, it can be comfortably subdivided to handle a 150,000-sf tenant. That is not much smaller than the first building constructed in Majestic Commercenter in 1996, which spanned 180,000-sf. Given the appetite for big ecommerce users such as Google and Amazon, it is even possible that one company could devour the entire warehouse enchilada. Not that the size of Building 15 is a surprise. When initially planning Majestic Commercenter in the mid-1990s, it was always envisioned that single buildings could be even bigger, topping 800,000 sf, Randy Hertel, an executive vice president of Majestic Realty, told me this week. And going forward, it is possible that Majestic might build a single building approaching 1.5 million sf in size, said Hertel, who has been with Majestic Commercenter since the initial 650 acres were purchased in 1995. (Majestic Realty, by the way, is owned by California billionaire Edward Roski, Jr. Roski is partners with Denver-based Philip Anschutz on such high-profile ventures as the LA Kings hockey steam, the Staples Center in Los Angeles and L.A. Live, a sports and entertainment district surrounding the Staples Center). Majestic Realty now owns 850 acres in Majestic Commercenter, with 450 acres to still develop. In addition, last year, Majestic Realty bought another 500 acres of adjoining land, giving it control of 1,350 acres of industrial along Interstate 70, east of Tower Road. There is enough land for another six buildings, each with 1 million sf, he noted. This illustration shows how 10 Statutes of Liberties could fit in Building 15 in the Majestic Commercenter in Aurora. “Across the country, you don’t find too many buildings bigger than a million sq ft, although you might find some1.5 million-sf in a big industrial city like Chicago,” Hertel said. “For one thing, it takes 50 acres of land to build a million-sf building and not every city has that much vacant property available.” H Currently, there are 14 buildings, 100 percent leased, with a total of 3.4 million sf of space at Majestic Commercenter. JP Morgan Chase is providing the construction financing for Building 15, which will open in 2018. Majestic uses in-house architects to design properties in its nationwide portfolio. “I think what surprises me more than the size of Building 15 is that in 15 months we are going to increase the size of Majestic Commercenter by half what took us 22 years to build,” Hertel said. Randy Hertel. Talking to him, I did not get the impression that Majestic has an attitude of “if you build it, they will come.” Rather, Majestic is meeting demand, which speaks volumes about the growth in Denver area from everything from the strength of homebuilders who need storage space to e-commerce giants. “I think it says a lot about our economy, the number of people moving here and our low unemployment rate,” Hertel said. “And while our overall industrial rate vacancy rate of about 4 percent may not be an all-time low, it is below the 5 percent vacancy rate, which is considered equilibrium.” The size of the Building 15 also speaks to the attractiveness of the Majestic Commercenter. “When we first opened, there were a lot of industrial parks at places like Stapleton, which were considered more attractive to users because they were closer to Denver than us,” Hertel said. “Now, we are really an infill site and most of our competitors are to the east of us,” he said. The one thing you won’t find in any of the existing or new buildings in the Majestic Commercenter are weed warehouses. Majestic prohibits any marijuana operations in the industrial park. “We provide Class A space for major national and international names,” which don’t want to have neighbors in the marijuana business, he said. Even if they allowed growhouses or marijuana storage, it’s unlikely there would be any takers. “The marijuana business typically takes Class C properties like old, vacated factories,” he said. As those buildings have been snapped up, marijuana operators have been moving into Class B buildings, but even then, they don’t need a 200,000-sf warehouse, he noted. An aerial view of the Majestic Commercenter. Majestic Realty is a true long-term owner. It has not sold any of the buildings it has constructed, although it has sold about 150 acres in Majestic Commercenter, primarily to users that want to own their own buildings. “We have been very patient over the years,” Hertel said. “During the down times, we put a hold on development and now during the good times, we are building. After 20 years or so of had work, we are an overnight success.” If you scratch the surface of just about any deal, there is a story behind it. The Rebchook Real Estate Corner looks at the what and who that make the Colorado commercial real estate industry spin every Tuesday and Thursday online at CREJ.com. The people behind the deals are passionate about what they do, whether they focus on offices, apartments, industrial, retail, land or lending. They also are passionate about their clients.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Apr 30, 2017 - Page 14　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp European stocks rally on French election Bloomberg European stocks posted their biggest weekly gain since December last year, fueled by the first-round win of a pro-euro candidate in the French presidential election and a raft of stronger corporate earnings. The STOXX Europe 600 on Friday slipped 0.2 percent, reducing the five-day gain to 2.4 percent, after eurozone consumer prices rose slightly more than expected, failing to stir markets after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said inflation was still too weak to rein in stimulus. Stocks on Monday rallied the most since June last year after a political centrist won the first round of French election. Robust corporate earnings from companies, including Credit Suisse Group AG and Volvo AB, also bolstered markets. European markets are to be closed on Monday for the Workers’ Day holiday. With about one-third of companies having reported earnings so far this season among STOXX 600 members, earnings per share has jumped an annual 24 percent, on track to be the biggest increase since the third quarter of 2010, according to data from JPMorgan Asset Management strategists Emmanuel Cau and Mislav Matejka. “The hard data for equities is earnings — and they are powering ahead. Q1 earnings season is very strong and revisions trends are positive and broad-based,” said analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA Merrill Lynch), who forecast 15 percent earnings growth for European companies and a further 8 percent rally for the STOXX 600. Draghi on Thursday showed growing enthusiasm about the state of the eurozone economy, while saying that inflationary pressures remain too weak to contemplate paring back monetary stimulus. Eurozone consumer prices this month rose an annual 1.9 percent, exceeding the estimate from economists for 1.8 percent. Investors poured US$2.4 billion into European equity funds in the week through Wednesday, the most since December 2015, according to a BofA Merrill Lynch note. There is a significant opportunity in the region’s equities, as the French election is likely to drive a lower risk premium and support “risk on” trade across the region, Citigroup’s equity strategists, including Jonathan Stubbs, wrote in note. Among the most active shares, Barclays PLC dropped 5.2 percent, the most since June last yaer, after trading revenue declined surprisingly in the first quarter.

(NYSE: CMG) released its first-quarter earnings report after the markets closed on Tuesday. Although Chipotle shares closed out lower on the week, the stock still saw a solid uptick from its earnings report, if only briefly. This was enough to pique the interest of a few analysts and even push price targets higher for this burrito business. This might be the beginning of the turnaround for Chipotle, even if analysts are not entirely on board. 24/7 Wall St. has included some brief highlights from the report, as well as what a few analysts are saying about this burrito chain after these results were announced. Chipotle posted $1.60 in earnings per share (EPS) and $1.07 billion in revenue, which compared to consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters that called for $1.27 in EPS and revenue in $1.05 billion. The same period of last year reportedly had a net loss of $0.88 per share and $834.46 million in revenue. Reduced promotional activity and improved traffic help to push comparable restaurant sales even higher this quarter. The average check also increased during the quarter. Comparable restaurant sales increased 17.8%, which included a benefit of 0.6% due to previously deferred revenue related to Chiptopia recognized during the quarter. Restaurant-level operating margin was 17.7% in the quarter, an increase of 6.8% in the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by sales leverage, lower marketing and promotional spend. In terms of the outlook for the full year, the company expects to see comparable restaurant sales in the high-single digits, with 195 to 210 new restaurant openings. The consensus estimates are $8.15 in EPS and $4.58 billion in revenue for the coming year. Analysts had this to say after earnings: Nomura reiterated a Hold rating with a $510 price target. Stephens has an Underweight rating but raised its price target to $350 from $325. JPMorgan has a Neutral rating and raised its price target to $420 from $365. Jefferies has an Underperform rating but raised its price target from $300 to $350. Deutsche Bank has a Sell rating and raised its price target to $300 from $280. Cowen has a Market Perform rating and raised its price target to $440 from $375. SunTrust Banks has a Buy rating and raised its price target from $500 to $550. Piper Jaffray has an Overweight rating and raised its price target to $530 from $483. Instinet has a Neutral rating and raised its price target to $510 from $333. Barclays has an Equal Weight rating and raised its price target to $415 from $395. Oppenheimer reiterated a Market Perform rating. Maxim has a Hold rating and raised its price target from $430 to $440. Telsey Advisory Group has a Market Perform rating and raised its price target to $440 from $400. Shares of Chipotle ended the week at $474.47, with a consensus analyst price target of $445.38 and a 52-week trading range of $352.96 to $497.48.

The New York Post reports that the investment bank’s investors approved CEO Blankfein’s $22 million compensation package on Friday, with 93% of shareholders giving the thumbs-up — a far friendlier reception than last year. That’s despite the fact that Goldman just posted a shockingly rough first quarter, with trading revenue flat while rivals like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan posted big gains. Goldman simplified its boss’s pay for 2016, while lowering it by $1 million from his 2015 total compensation.

He appointed Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and CEO of private-equity firm Blackstone Group, to head his economic advisory council. Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, two former Goldman Sachs executives, were named to key administration posts. The president has met regularly with dozens of CEOs, who have helped shape his views on how policy affects the economy and how to create jobs. "I do strongly believe he is listening," Larry Fink, the CEO of the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, said at a dinner earlier this month hosted by the Economic Club of Washington. A majority of Trump's executive actions have targeted regulations or come to the aid of specific industries, like steel and aluminum. Seeking to reduce the burdens on banks, Trump has singled out specific parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law for review. At the same time, Trump has failed to deliver on any major legislative priorities, most notably on the Republican promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. Details of many of his initiatives are scant, as evidenced this week when Mnuchin and Cohn unveiled a tax reform plan that they summarized in one page. "Washington is now figuring out what is rhetoric and what is a promise he made on the campaign trail that he's going to keep," said one business executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. And representatives in some business sectors say they have had trouble getting their message heard. Bill Brown, the president of the National Association of Realtors, a trade group with 1.1 million members, opposes Trump's directive to reverse a cut on some mortgage premiums that would potentially make it more expensive to own a home. Brown says he has made several attempts to set up a meeting with the president but has yet to meet with him. "We want to emphasize home ownership to the president," he said. Other industry groups, such as the American Petroleum Institute and the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, have objected to the president's "Buy American" plan because of its ripple effects. The plan calls for new oil pipelines to use American-made steel, which they say will ultimately drive costs higher. But for now, executives are still largely happy with Trump. They know it will take time before any policy changes take root. In public statements and interviews this week with CNNMoney, a number of executive and business lobbyists say they believe the central promise to loosen regulatory burdens on their businesses will eventually help boost their bottom lines. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a member of the president's economic council, said on a recent earnings call that any new administration experiences "ups and downs, wins and losses." He focused on Trump's stated "pro-growth agenda -- tax, infrastructure, regulatory reform -- and that is a good thing." Dimon isn't alone. A survey of chief executives by the Conference Board showed executive confidence rose again in the first quarter to the highest it's been in 13 years. The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group representing 11,000 small and large companies, said 93% of members surveyed last month were positive about the economic outlook -- the highest in the survey's 20-year history. Jay Timmons, the organization's president and chief executive, said members have responded strongly to Trump's plans to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%. "He went directly at the problem we have. We are simply not as competitive because of how our tax are structured," said Timmons. "Frankly, we were pretty proud that he stood up for us." The Trump administration has "changed the tone," said Camden Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America. "The tone in the prior administration was regulate, regulate, regulate." The country was on the precipice of a global financial meltdown when former President Obama took office in 2009. Wall Street was at the center of it. Obama's chief aim after stabilizing things as to put safeguards in place so another crisis would never happen again. That eventually became Dodd-Frank, the largest regulatory overhaul since the Great Depression. But Trump hates regulations and has pledged to do a "big number on Dodd-Frank." Mnuchin has started to review regulations that could be stifling economic growth. Treasury Department staffers have hosted at least 20 focus groups, often with roughly 40 business leaders at a time, to hear ideas about how to provide regulatory relief to the financial sector. Already, insurance giant MetLife has seized on Trump's decision to halt regulators from labeling any firm as too-big-to-fail until Treasury is done with its review. The company has asked a court to pause a lawsuit. Copyright 2017 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Deutsche Bank AG has named Citigroup Inc. Treasurer James von Moltke as its new Chief Financial Officer. Von Moltke, 48, is a former investment banker, and has been Citigroup’s treasurer since September 2015. News reports said he will join Deutsche Bank in July. He replaces CFO Marcus Schenck, who will become co-head the investment bank and trading businesses. In March, Schenck was named deputy chief executive officer under Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan. Von Moltke began his career at Credit Suisse First Boston in London 25 years ago, and worked at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley before joining Citigroup in 2009, according to Deutsche Bank. As CFO at Deutsche Bank, reports say he will be charged with delivering intensive cost-cutting efforts because the bank suffered lackluster profit results in its biggest businesses. Earlier in April, Deutsche Bank completed an $8.5 billion capital increase through its third share sale since 2013. Under Cryan, Deutsche Bank is still restructuring almost two years after it reassigned many of its senior management and overhauled its biggest businesses, including the investment bank. At Citigroup, von Moltke worked in restructuring after the 2008 financial crisis and worked on company-wide financial strategy. Reports said this was a major reason why he was hired at Deutsche Bank.  Tags: Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, von Moltke By Chuck Epstein « Goldman Survey Finds Insurance Execs Upbeat About Markets, Wary of Political Risks Most Popular Wisconsin Pension Fund Managers Receive $14 Million in Bonuses Subscribe Verizon Borrows $3.4 Billion to Make Discretionary Pension Contribution Kingsley: Real Estate Remains Most Attractive Asset Class for ‘17 Registration FOLLOW CIO CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER All News Surveys All Lists Events Multimedia Thought Leadership Alert Archive ABOUT CIO About Us Contact Us Global Editorial Calendar Global Media Kit Privacy Policy ADVERTISE WITH CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER GO TO STRATEGIC INSIGHT LATEST ISSUE February 2017 GET ACCESS TO CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER EVERYWHERE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER IS OPTIMIZED FOR SUBSCRIBE TO THE PRINT EDITION looking for Subscriber Services?

By: Bloomberg | Published: April 29, 2017 5:30 PM The trial opens a rare window into the frenzied weekend before Lehman’s bankruptcy filing on Sept. 15, 2008. (Reuters) Almost a decade after the global financial crisis, the fate of another $2 billion from the wreckage of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is about to be determined. The failed New York investment bank is seeking to recoup the cash from one of its old derivatives trading partners, Citigroup Inc. In a trial that started this week in Manhattan bankruptcy court, Lehman alleges Citigroup created “phantom transaction costs” in order to justify a bankruptcy claim that would allow it to keep $2 billion in cash Lehman had deposited on the trades. Citigroup contends it did nothing wrong and used reasonable practices. The trial opens a rare window into the frenzied weekend before Lehman’s bankruptcy filing on Sept. 15, 2008. Banks were supposed to use a Sunday trading session to mitigate damage to the financial system by reducing their exposure to the bank. Lehman, which first sued over the $2 billion in 2012, claims that Citigroup efficiently hedged its risks, but went on to inflate its claim by marking its books to its benefit. Also watch: The proceeding is being closely watched by the derivatives industry, which has been overhauling the way it manages counterparty risk. There are unresolved questions about whether the market’s shift to using central clearinghouses is effective, said Peter Niculescu, a partner at Capital Market Risk Advisors. The firm advises financial institutions and law firms on issues including the termination of derivatives agreements, and has represented around 15 parties with regards to their Lehman exposure, but not Citigroup. Seeking Clarity “Most banks are of the opinion that the non-defaulting counterparty is entitled to the replacement cost, whether or not they do in fact replace the position” Niculescu said, adding that there is hope the Lehman and Citigroup trial will provide clarity on that point. Proceedings that began Tuesday, arising from the 2012 lawsuit, will decide whether Citigroup has to return any of the money. Lawyers and witnesses will delve into how the two financial behemoths behaved on the eve of a bankruptcy that helped throw the global financial system into disarray. At the time of the bankruptcy, it and Citigroup had entered into more than 30,000 derivatives trades tied to an estimated $1.18 trillion of wagers on everything from interest rates to corporate and sovereign debt. Lehman’s bankruptcy gave Citigroup the right to terminate the agreements and determine its damages. ‘Cherry-Picked’ Lehman claims that in the days, and even months after its bankruptcy, Citigroup concocted an inflated claim, which it eventually filed in September 2009. Lawyers for Lehman said in court Wednesday that traders at Citigroup were instructed to stray from convention in valuing their positions. Instead of pricing trades at the mid-point of bid and offer prices, the bank marked the trades on one side or the other, depending on which was to their advantage. “Citi cherry-picked the valuation curve,” said Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Lehman, while showing a crowded courtroom slide after slide of charts and Citigroup derivatives trades. Danielle Romero, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said Thursday that the bank “has always acted appropriately.” “Citi will continue to vigorously pursue its right to recover the substantial damages it is owed as a result of Lehman’s breach of contract and will vigorously defend against Lehman’s attempts to limit those rights,” she said by email. Testimony from some of Citigroup’s top bankers, including Carey Lathrop and Brian Archer, will shed the first light on the unwinding of Lehman trades and the management of such counterparty risk. Around a dozen other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., have settled similar issues, leaving only a dispute over a $1 billion claim with Credit Suisse Group AG remaining. One Night Marc Pagano, who ran Citigroup’s emerging-markets business at the time and was involved in closing out some of his group’s trades, was asked in a phone conversation — a recording of which was played in court Wednesday — whether traders were supposed to mark their books under a different methodology than usual. “Yeah, one night. One night only,” Pagano said in the call. “We only deviated one night.” Pagano didn’t return a message seeking comment. Citigroup says it used its best professional judgment to determine close-out amounts on the trades. The contracts, the bank said, were governed by International Swaps & Derivatives Association master agreements, which give the non-defaulting party — in this case Citigroup — the right to assess the close-out costs as long as it uses commercially reasonable procedures. Citigroup disputes Lehman’s allegation that it replaced the trades quickly and efficiently. Instead, it “adopted a triage approach and executed blunt, first-order hedges” that usually only addressed part of its risk, according to Citigroup’s filings in the case. The trial, before U.S. bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman, is expected to run until May 17, according to court papers. The adversary suit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., et al v. Citibank N.A., 12-01044, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York. No Comments.

The Russell 1000 Growth index, which tracks such shares, is up 10.9 percent so far this year, outpacing the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index's 6.6 percent rise and the 2.8 percent advance of the Russell 1000 Value index. And it's not just a U.S. phenomenon. Growth stocks - whose profits are expected to grow at a faster pace than the broader market - are also outperforming their value counterparts in Asia and Europe. Still, the appeal of riskier stocks perceived as better positioned to ride an accelerating global earnings tailwind, as opposed to those with a greater cushion of safety, is nowhere as far ahead as it is on Wall Street. In the United States, an improving outlook for corporate earnings should help keep growth names in vogue, according to John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. The average estimate of analysts for earnings per share growth this year of S&P 500 companies has risen to 11.3 percent from 10.9 percent at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data, a trend that should continue to blunt concerns about lofty growth valuations. "When you have an earnings recovery, growth stocks will outperform. When you don't have good earnings, that's when people are looking for value," said Praveen. Hopes for pro-business U.S. policy changes under the administration of President Donald Trump will likely also keep expectations for economic growth elevated, helping to maintain the case for growth stocks. "The value stocks have done okay but growth has done so much better in the anticipation we'll see a pickup in economic growth," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. "Companies that are going to be more levered to economic growth tend to be growth stocks." "Right now I don't see a long term condition for value stocks to outperform growth," said Nolte. To be sure, some strategists are less convinced that growth stock outperformance will continue indefinitely. While value stocks, which are cheaper relative to their earnings potential, have tended to do better in slower growth environments historically, JP Morgan Asset Management's global market strategist David Lebovitz says that trend has been changing. "It’s not going to be smooth sailing for one or the other. We think there'll be times people are more optimistic about the economy and in those cases, value can rally. Then you'll see periods where people are less optimistic about the economy, as we've seen over the course of the first quarter," he said. If economic trends look better in the second quarter, value stocks will do better, Lebovitz said. In Asia, the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan growth index, is up 18.5 percent so far this year, compared with a 12.6 percent gain for the comparable MSCI value index. Investment in India, traditionally a growth-driven market, has adjusted in recent years as value stocks have narrowed the gap with growth, which still lead, said Jayesh Shroff, co-founder of investment advisory Cask Capital in Mumbai. "That is because people were paying a premium for growth and somehow the growth did not materialize. That's why value came back and growth has taken a slight back seat," said Shroff. Still, he said as soon as growth returns, he expects investors to switch their focus back from value. In China, between 2009 and the 2015 stock market crash, small-cap growth stocks were the market’s darlings, but "a new rotation into value blue-chip investments started in 2016,” according to Zhou Liang, fund manager at Shanghai Minority Asset Management Co. “In 2017, money will flow into blue-chips, as small-caps weaken and lose their luster,” said Zhou. In Europe, the best outlook for corporate profits in seven years has ignited investor appetite for growth stocks, which are now up twice as much as their value counterparts so far this year, a reversal of the trend seen last year. As a result the MSCI International Europe growth Index has jumped 8.9 percent this year so far, compared with a 4.5 percent gain for the MSCI International Europe Value index. With such a big gap between U.S. growth and value stocks, some investors are eying overseas investments. "The entire U.S. market is very expensive. Value investors definitely don't like to chase expensive valuations," said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. "I wouldn't expect to see a rotation until you saw a correction where both stock types are lower."

Home Entertainment Nigerian Newspapers Nigeria News TV Stations Videos Music Videos News Videos YOHAIG Think YOruba HAusa IGbo What the NIA N13b Slush Fund Was Meant For: Following the money trail Posted April 29, 2017 7:51 am by admin Comments By Tony Eluemunor Little by little, droplets of information concerning the N13 billion uncovered in an Ikoyi luxury apartment seems to be seeping onto the public space. Yet, instead of the public being enlightened more and more by the bits of information that come through, the waters actually appear to be muddied up the more. No, this is not about the outlandish claim that the money belongs to Rivers state government where a former State Governor was alleged to have diverted it from. Some folks have even gone to the way ward extent of accusing the Federal Government of conjuring out the sum just so that the populace could be diverted from the hardship and ills unleashed on Nigerians by the economic recession. Yet, since this immediate past Monday, some little drops of facts have been coming in. Unfortunately too, some persons have made it to appear that the stashing of the money was as normal to a security agency as breathing is to man. To put this in proper perspective, Mr. Segun Adeniyi encapsulated the thinking pattern of this group when he wrote on Thursday April 27, 2017 in his THISDAY newspaper column: “I want to reserve my comments on how Nigeria has suddenly become “treasure island” where huge sums of money that have no owners are now being found almost on a daily basis. I will also keep the powder dry on the controversial N13 billion (in local and foreign currencies) belonging to the National Intelligent Agency (NIA). While the suspended NIA Director General, Ambassador Ayo Oke bungled what ordinarily should be a simple covert operation (moving cash), I also believe the EFCC should have been discrete in handling the matter given the important national security projects involved. What I find most reprehensible is the attempt to drag in the name of President Goodluck Jonathan to score a cheap political point. I have it on good authority that President Jonathan indeed approved the projects and directed the release of the 289 million Dollars to the NIA in February 2015. But those claiming that President Muhammadu Buhari is not aware of the money (including the balance of more than 30 million Dollars that is still in NIA custody) and the projects involved don’t know what they are talking about. Well, if we take Mr. Adeniyi seriously, those “who don’t know what they are talking about” include all the members of the House of Representatives, who have resolved to: “ascertain the owner of the money which was discovered by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) courtesy of a whistle-blower. The resolution followed the adoption of a motion sponsored by Hon Gabriel Kolawole who said ‘There is need for thorough investigation into the matter in order to ascertain the source of the money given the claims on its ownership, purpose and the damaging effects it is having on Federal Government’s anti-corruption drive,’”. Here, already, Representative Kolawole’s perspective is more all-encompassing than Segun Adeniyi’s which left out the question of what the money was meant for. I take it for granted that from the tone of Mr. Adeniyi’s article, he may have seen the documents Ambassador Ayodele Oke used in briefing President Mohammadu Buhari. Even then, what has been left unsaid is where the money emanated from, and what it was approved for. Was it appropriately budgeted for the usage of the NIA (National Intelligence Agency)? Enough of the preamble: I begin by saying that as the budget of the NIA in the year in question, 2015 (an election year) was all of $ 160m then why would the government make an extra-budgetary allocation of all of $ 289m to the same agency? It is from this point that every attempt to unravel the facts must begin. Also, the problem of what the money was meant for becomes clearer when one remembers that this extra-budgetary allocation to NIA was made at the same time with the money that was supposed to buy arms to combat Boko Haram insurgency, the handling of which is still being looked into by the courts as the government has alleged that the former National Security Adviser (NSA) Col Dasuki (rtd) used the money for other purposes. It is on record though that Dasuki has denied any wrong doing. Yet, as allegations go, the nation has heard tales of how the money meant to fight Boko Haram was diverted to aid former President Jonathan’s 2015 re-election bid. So, too, this emolument to NIA was meant to prepare some security outfits for some civil and non-civil battles that some folks close to government were sure would result from the election that they had thought Jonathan would win. On the civil front, the NIA money was to be used in acquiring the services of some top-flight PR agencies in the Western World to paint the Nigerian administration of 2015 in illustrious light and defend the outcome of the election to high heavens. Also, as the disregard for the Jonathan administration in the US, Britain and other leading capitals of the West, NIA would was to use part of the money to obtain the services of uncommon lobbyists and opinion leaders to advance the course of the Jonathan administration and get the Western nations to see its point of view and see it in good light. In the third leg of the civil action, some Nigerians were supposed to be sent to various capital cities to defend the Jonathan administration before the press and to win over foreign opinion leaders . Yet, it is the uncivil aspect of the war that would shock Nigerians if it ever officially comes to light; this is because the NIA was supposed to equip some armies – both private and certain cells of Nigerian official security agencies – to arise and contain the bloody uprising that they feared would have arisen had Jonathan won the election and some parts of Nigeria decided to oppose him. It is no secret that the money came from the coffers of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The money found in the Ikoyi flat is what remained of the $ 289, 222, 382 that was disbursed in 2015. In fact, this entire controversy shows the failure of the Nigerian media and security agencies to follow the money trail. If they have been doing this duty, they would have paid attention to the American Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), in one of its special reports on Boko Haram and corruption in Nigeria; it publicly exhibited the document bearing the signatures of an Oil Minister and a Permanent Secretary, in the transfer of money to NIA. Part of the money was wired to New York City headquarters of a U.S. multinational banking and financial services holding company; JPMorgan Chase & Co. The date therein is February 2, 2015! In that same expose where injured Nigerian soldiers uncovered how their commanders would tell them that they lacked even bullets or petrol to get their vehicles to take them out of harm’s way and would leave them to survive any way they could, even an Adviser to Buhari Professor Bolaji Owasonoye was interviewed. It is instructive that Owasonoye complained that the money given to NSA’s office and the NIA were not spent in ways that would benefit the country. So, the question crops up: why did the Buhari administration not swing into immediate action to either recover what remained of the money or to rein in those who had the authority to spend it? The answer is simply this: the members of the administration did not know what the money was meant for and whether any amount of the money that was disbursed in February 2015 would have still been lying fallow somewhere. In fact the existence of such funds somewhere in Osborn Road, Ikoyi, Lagos flat, after two years, would have seemed implausible. So, how was the money found? The Segun Adeniyis made it appear that the suspended DG may have briefed the President but a cunning Buhari dipped the information in controversy by making EFCC to have made a dramatic find in that Osborn apartment – all in a bid to demonise former President Jonathan, under whose presidential watch the NIA slush fund was actually and incontrovertibly created. But the general belief out there is that a whistle-blower for a fee was at work. The truth is that a former NIA officer wrote a petition against Ambassador Oke, and the rest, they say, is the history that is now being written. And that is why this matter is weighty, no matter how lightly some newspaper columnists and sundry commentators may make it appear. It is from such slush funds that private armies are funded.       The post What the NIA N13b Slush Fund Was Meant For: Following the money trail appeared first on Vanguard News. What do you think?

Total dollar revenue from trading stocks and bonds at Barclays, Deutsche Bank, UBS Group and Credit Suisse Group fell 6 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 15 percent increase for their five biggest U.S. rivals. The Europeans' total share of the market, which was 35 percent three years ago, dropped below 26 percent for a second straight quarter, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. While some of the dip is by design — as the European banks try to cut risk and free up capital dedicated to illiquid trading positions — all four firms fell short of analysts' trading estimates in the quarter. VIDEOS TOP JOBS An enduring decline could threaten the viability of their turnaround efforts and scare away investors. "European banks are on the back foot trying to defend market shares," said Gildas Surry, an analyst at Axiom Alternative Investments in London that manages 800 million euros ($871 million) of financial-sector debt. "The loss of market share reduces profitability, weakens the diversification benefits, and keeps European banks in a defensive mode." Barclays reported Friday that fixed-income revenue fell to 889 million pounds, a 14 percent decline in dollar terms. The result was "well below peers," Citigroup analyst Andrew Coombs wrote to clients. Shares of the London-based lender fell 5.2 percent, the most in ten months. "We're not going to shy away from the fact that we hoped to do better on the trading side in some of our markets businesses," Barclays Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley said on a conference call with analysts this morning. "We're disappointed with how we did." Earlier in the morning, UBS reported that fixed-income trading revenue fell more than 6 percent to 452 million Swiss francs ($455 million). Deutsche Bank, once among the world's top bond traders, and Credit Suisse both posted debt-trading sales that fell below analysts' estimates earlier this week. Still, the loss of ground wasn't as dire as in the fourth quarter, when the European firms' share of trading revenue plunged to a post-crisis low. Reasons for the first-quarter underperformance vary. Barclays executives cited a poor effort in trading products tied to interest rates in the U.S., a business where Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase said they gained in the quarter. Deutsche Bank blamed its performance in part on its exit from trading securitized products, another business that provided gains for U.S. banks. Credit Suisse attributed its result to lack of client interest in equity derivatives, complex products tied to shares. BNP Paribas and Societe Generale are set to report results next week. "By trimming back into what they consider more profitable FICC businesses, the revenues will be hurt," Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London, said of Deutsche Bank. Whatever the reason, rivals across the Atlantic are feasting on weakness. Citigroup, which has been selling assets and exiting businesses since the financial crisis, boosted bond-trading revenue 19 percent in the first quarter and CEO Mike Corbat declared the New York-based bank's restructuring complete on April 25. Wall Street banks may gain even more as President Donald Trump pledges to roll back regulations and bolster the economy, just as European banks struggle to meet tougher capital rules on the continent. And while European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has ushered in negative interest rates across the euro zone, Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen intends to raise them in the U.S. "The trading results show the different regulatory climate under which the banks operate," said Surry, the Axiom analyst. "This is threatening the European champions." Staley, Barclays CEO since late 2015, last year warned that a combination of new rules, low interest rates and the legal costs arising from past misdeeds has placed many European investment banks "at the brink." The continent's capital markets may soon be "almost entirely dependent on firms domiciled elsewhere," he said at a May 24 speech in Brussels.

The Russell 1000 Growth index, which tracks such shares, is up 10.9 per cent so far this year, outpacing the US benchmark S&P 500 stock index's 6.6 per cent rise and the 2.8 per cent advance of the Russell 1000 Value index. And it's not just a US phenomenon. Growth stocks - whose profits are expected to grow at a faster pace than the broader market - are also outperforming their value counterparts in Asia and Europe. Still, the appeal of riskier stocks perceived as better positioned to ride an accelerating global earnings tailwind, as opposed to those with a greater cushion of safety, is nowhere as far ahead as it is on Wall Street. In the United States, an improving outlook for corporate earnings should help keep growth names in vogue, according to John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. The average estimate of analysts for earnings per share growth this year of S&P 500 companies has risen to 11.3 per cent from 10.9 per cent at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data, a trend that should continue to blunt concerns about lofty growth valuations. "When you have an earnings recovery, growth stocks will outperform. When you don't have good earnings, that's when people are looking for value," said Praveen. Hopes for pro-business US policy changes under the administration of President Donald Trump will likely also keep expectations for economic growth elevated, helping to maintain the case for growth stocks. "The value stocks have done okay but growth has done so much better in the anticipation we'll see a pickup in economic growth," said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. "Companies that are going to be more levered to economic growth tend to be growth stocks." "Right now I don't see a long term condition for value stocks to outperform growth," said Nolte. To be sure, some strategists are less convinced that growth stock outperformance will continue indefinitely. While value stocks, which are cheaper relative to their earnings potential, have tended to do better in slower growth environments historically, JP Morgan Asset Management's global market strategist David Lebovitz says that trend has been changing. "It’s not going to be smooth sailing for one or the other. We think there'll be times people are more optimistic about the economy and in those cases, value can rally. Then you'll see periods where people are less optimistic about the economy, as we've seen over the course of the first quarter," he said. If economic trends look better in the second quarter, value stocks will do better, Lebovitz said. In Asia, the MSCI AC Asia ex Japan growth index, is up 18.5 per cent so far this year, compared with a 12.6 per cent gain for the comparable MSCI value index. Investment in India, traditionally a growth-driven market, has adjusted in recent years as value stocks have narrowed the gap with growth, which still lead, said Jayesh Shroff, co-founder of investment advisory Cask Capital in Mumbai. "That is because people were paying a premium for growth and somehow the growth did not materialize. That's why value came back and growth has taken a slight back seat," said Shroff. Still, he said as soon as growth returns, he expects investors to switch their focus back from value. In China, between 2009 and the 2015 stock market crash, small-cap growth stocks were the market’s darlings, but "a new rotation into value blue-chip investments started in 2016,” according to Zhou Liang, fund manager at Shanghai Minority Asset Management Co. “In 2017, money will flow into blue-chips, as small-caps weaken and lose their luster,” said Zhou. In Europe, the best outlook for corporate profits in seven years has ignited investor appetite for growth stocks, which are now up twice as much as their value counterparts so far this year, a reversal of the trend seen last year. As a result the MSCI International Europe growth Index has jumped 8.9 per cent this year so far, compared with a 4.5 per cent gain for the MSCI International Europe Value index. With such a big gap between US growth and value stocks, some investors are eying overseas investments. "The entire US market is very expensive. Value investors definitely don't like to chase expensive valuations," said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. "I wouldn't expect to see a rotation until you saw a correction where both stock types are lower."

Bloomberg News reports that the firm posted a surprise drop in fixed-income trading revenue, in contrast with a collective 24 percent jump achieved by its five largest American counterparts. Income from equities, the other main trading business, also fell more than expected. “We didn’t have the uptick that a number of the U.S. banks did,” Staley said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We could have done a little better on the U.S. rates side, but we’re not going to make any judgments on one quarter.” The trading performance marked the first quarter under Tim Throsby, who was poached from JPMorgan Chase & Co. last year to help turn around the investment bank. Staley has touted the need for Europe to have a successful investment bank based in the region, as American firms have seized share in the trading and merger advisory businesses in recent years.
