Is it too little too late? Mobile by Sean Hollister December 27, 2016 12:00 PM PST @starfire2258 Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them If Microsoft could go back in time, I've a pretty good idea what would happen. CEO Satya Nadella would hand his younger self the code for Microsoft's new Win32 on ARM emulator. It's the missing piece of the puzzle that could finally let Microsoft build Windows phones, razor-thin tablets and tiny laptops that people might actually want to buy. It could have maybe saved Microsoft billions of dollars and thousands of jobs, if the company had had it just a few years ago. See, Win32 refers to the traditional Windows desktop apps you know and love, like Office and Photoshop, VLC and Steam. Thing is, the versions of Windows that ran on phones or thin tablets never could use those all-important Win32 apps -- because the energy-efficient ARM processors that powered those devices weren't compatible. Would you rather have a thicker tablet, or a thinner, cheaper tablet that couldn't run all your apps? That was the choice in 2012, but Microsoft didn't make it clear.Photo by Josh Lowensohn/CNET It was actually quite the scandal back in 2012, when Microsoft tried to sell the first Microsoft Surface RT tablet with a stripped-down version of Windows -- Windows RT -- instead of the real thing. Microsoft lost nearly a billion dollars when the Surface RT didn't sell, and nearly $8 billion more when it had to write off all its Nokia phones. But this year, Microsoft says it's finally cracked the code. On December 7, the company announced it would bring the full Windows 10 operating system, including Win32 apps, to ARM-based Qualcomm processors. That means real Windows desktop apps could run on phones -- and beyond. Is it too little too late? Here are five reasons why this single achievement could change the computing landscape -- and three ways it could fail yet again. Why Windows on ARM could succeed Enlarge Image The Surface Book is nearly an inch thick. (The Surface Pro 4 is a third of an inch -- but the iPad is less than a quarter-inch thick.)Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET 1) Windows tablets could trounce the iPad The Surface Pro and Surface Book might be awesome Windows computers, but no one's mistaking them for an Apple iPad -- they're comparatively thick, heavy and generally far more expensive. Meanwhile, Apple's iPad still hasn't quite gotten to the point where it can replace a computer for many people. (That's probably why the Mac still exists.) Microsoft's Windows 10 OS has the chops to be for both a PC and a tablet, but few companies have managed to produce a competitive tablet using Intel processors. (The Samsung TabPro S is an exception to the rule.) Qualcomm's chips, with built-in wireless connectivity, could bring the battery life and always-on internet connection that Intel hasn't up to now. 2) Windows phones could turn up the heat HP's Elite x3 turns into a Windows desktop when you dock it. It can even run Win32 desktop apps -- if you pay for HP to host them on cloud servers.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Right now, Android and Apple are your only viable options for a smartphone, but that could change. Windows phones -- ones that support all the traditional Windows apps, anyhow -- might be attractive enough to pose a real alternative. What if your phone could turn into a full Windows desktop or laptop when you plug it into a dock? It's an idea that's been tried before, but never with a Windows desktop that actually ran desktop apps on the phone itself. That's now theoretically possible with Windows on ARM, and it's something both PC makers and phone makers can now pursue. If enough people buy into the idea, the mobile app developers that once skipped Windows Phone might give it another chance, too. 3) VR and AR Windows is where the hottest virtual and augmented reality experiences live, but they're not particularly portable. They're all either tethered to Windows desktops or laptops, or have poor battery life (Microsoft HoloLens). To cut the cord and venture out into the real world with smaller, standalone headsets, we need lightweight, always-connected-to-the-internet processors that last more than a few hours on a charge. That's what Qualcomm's ARM chips do best, by baking the cellular radios right into the processor instead of requiring additional components. 4) Laptops get cellular superpowers, too How often do you wish your laptop had a cellular connection? Terrible coffee shop Wi-Fi could be a thing of the past with an ARM-powered Windows device. Today, you don't see a lot of cellular-powered laptops because it's a huge design constraint: Manufacturers have to make room for a removable cellular module and a SIM card tray, and install software to control the whole thing. But again, Qualcomm's chips have cellular built right in, and Microsoft says Windows will natively support tiny embedded reprogrammable SIM cards (eSIM) so there's no need to swap out SIMs. Of course, not every manufacturer will go to the trouble of adding cellular antennas, and you'll still need a data plan, but you can probably expect cellular models to be way more affordable than the $150-$300 premium you might pay today. (Plus, prices might come down if Intel and Qualcomm are competing to be in your next PC.) With fast future 5G networks, there may come a time when cell connectivity is the norm for computers.

Facebook's Oculus, Intel, Microsoft and Qualcomm all believe that standalone wireless VR headsets might be a new opportunity.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET 5) ARM processors might be fast enough to rival Intel chips now Sure, your phone isn't anywhere near as fast as a beefy gaming PC packed with Intel, AMD and Nvidia processors -- but you might be surprised how far mobile processors have come. In one benchmark, the ARM chip inside Apple's new iPhone 7 actually beats the Intel ones inside Apple's MacBook Air. The eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, the processor that Microsoft is targeting for this new Windows release, could be even more powerful. Putting benchmarks aside, Microsoft showed off a Windows 10 machine running Adobe Photoshop on a quad-core Snapdragon 820, and you can bet that tomorrow's eight-core Snapdragon 835 will be a good bit faster than that. Why Microsoft could crash and burn yet again 1) Windows desktop apps could still be slow Here's the thing about Microsoft's newfound app support: It uses an emulator, and emulators have a tendency to slow everything down. The emulator is a piece of software that lets your ARM-based Snapdragon chip pretend to be an Intel-like x86 processor, and every CPU cycle that maintains the disguise is one that's not being used to actually run your app. Which means that even if the Snapdragon 835 is just as fast as a comparable Intel chip, things will probably run a bit slower. We can't say how much slower, and Microsoft has built some impressive emulators in the past -- the Xbox One can now play Xbox 360 games thanks to the company's work. And a Microsoft representative tells CNET that Windows on ARM is relatively fast: "People will experience apps at a similar speed to what they experience on other, similarly priced PCs." Still, "there is always an overhead associated with emulation," Moor Insights and Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead tells us -- and also notes that emulators sometimes have difficulty supporting external devices like printers and scanners. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET 2) Who's going to actually build a Windows phone? Sure, Windows Phones could make meaningful competition for iPhone and Android -- but who's going to stick their necks out? Probably not Microsoft, whose phone ambitions got squashed when it had to part ways with Nokia. (We do still hear rumors about a Surface Phone, though.) Laptops and tablets are one thing, but a bunch of companies got burned trying to support the last big batch of Windows Phones (and Windows RT tablets), including a couple that have since called the phone business quits (Nokia and Dell). Are any OEMs brave enough to wholeheartedly support Microsoft against Apple and Google this time around? 3) Customers might not trust Microsoft again Microsoft is the proverbial boy who called wolf -- year after year, the company promised you'd finally be able to get full Windows on a thin tablet or phone. Even if that's about to become true, would you buy a Windows Phone or iPad-like device knowing how previous customers were left out in the cold? Microsoft's biggest fans who bought into Windows Phone found themselves unable to upgrade to newer versions of the operating system, and Microsoft did a pretty crappy job explaining to customers that Windows RT tablets wouldn't run their desktop apps. If Microsoft comes out and says, "No, this time we really mean it, you can actually have a functional Windows desktop on a tiny device," will customers believe them? Qualcomm tells CNET the first such devices will go on sale late in 2017. I guess that's when we'll know for sure.

Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favourable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device underperformed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the rollout of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10 per cent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky — opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and centre in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, Calif. headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips — a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple reorganized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 per cent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the colour didn't look good on such a large product. In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold colour option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the U.S. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the U.S. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our road map. Nobody should worry about that," chief executive officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touch screen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage.

The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York unveiled parallel charges Tuesday accusing Iat Hong, Bo Zheng and Hung Chin of netting about $4 million in illegal profits from stock trades based on nonpublic information from April 2014 to late 2015. The traders were also charged with attempting to breach five other law firms for the same purpose. Lawyers have become increasingly attractive targets to hackers in recent years given the amount of sensitive data that they inherently traffic in.

The names of the hacked law firms weren’t revealed Tuesday, but the charges indicate that one of the firms was breached during its involvement in two separate transactions tied to Bay Area companies. According to the indictment, one firm was tapped to represent Intel in its $16.7 billion acquisition of integrated circuit maker Altera. After breaching the firm’s network, the hackers allegedly extracted 2.8 gigabytes of emails between January and February 2015. Based on information on the emails, they bought 210,000 Altera shares. Intel announced its intent to acquire Altera on June 1, 2015, netting the traders $1.4 million in profit. An Intel spokesman said the company had no comment on the matter. In a press release announcing the Altera deal, Intel named law firms Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and Weil Gotshal & Manges. In March, the Wall Street Journal reported that federal investigators were looking into reports of hacks at Weil Gotshal and another law firm, Cravath Swain & Moore. Weil Gotshal declined to comment on the reports. The firm cited as the target in the Intel-Altera deal was also retained by an unnamed company that was considering acquiring Brisbane biotech firm InterMune in June 2014. Over the course of about 20 days, the traders downloaded 50 gigabytes of information from the law firm’s servers and purchased 18,000 InterMune shares. The firm’s client ended up dropping its bid for InterMune. The company was eventually purchased by Swiss drug giant Roche for $8.3 billion in August 2014, a deal that federal officials say netted the traders about $380,000. Roche did not respond to requests for comment. The second law firm was hacked in April 2015 while providing counsel to business services company Pitney Bowes, which was working to buy e-commerce company Borderfree. The traders allegedly made $841,000 after sifting through confidential information lifted from the law firm. Cravath Swain & Moore represented Pitney Bowes in the Borderfree deal. The Chinese traders used “unlawfully obtained credentials” stolen from employees of the respective firms to initiate the hacks, according to the indictment. The traders then allegedly installed malware that gave them access to the firms’ email servers, and to accounts of attorneys who were working on mergers and acquisitions. The traders bought shares of companies who appeared to be for sale, but before any sale was announced. Stock prices of target companies usually rise on news of an acquisition, giving traders with nonpublic information an unfair advantage. The indictments Tuesday in some ways echo the insider trading charges levied against an information-technology employee at prominent Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. In June 2015, Dmitry Braverman was sentenced to two years in prison after admitting to using confidential information to trade shares in companies that the firm was advising in deals. Last year, the American Bar Association reported that 15 percent of law firms have experienced a cybersecurity breach due to a hack, physical break-in or stolen smartphone. Larger firms may be more attractive targets: The Bar Association said that 1 in 4 law firms with at least 100 attorneys saw breaches. In 2012, the association reported that just 10 percent of law firms had experienced a breach. Notably, its research also indicated that 47 percent of the 90,000 lawyers it surveyed had no response plan in place to address a security breach.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 27, 2016 at 10:00AM According to personal computers next year. On deck are next-generation central processing units, faster graphics processors, and the addition of USB-C ports, Gurman says. Apple's iMac lineup. Image source: Apple.  In other words, a sensible set of upgrades and improvements, but nothing groundbreaking. Although not much is known about the iMac computers that will follow the ones that Apple has planned for next year, there is one upgrade that could prove to be quite compelling in the 2018 iMac models -- at least to power users. More processor cores Since 2009, Apple's premium iMac computers have featured processors with up to four processing cores supplied by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The processors Apple uses in the 2017 iMac models are likely to be Intel's seventh-generation Core processors. These chips will, just as their predecessors, also top out at four processor cores. Of course, over the years, those processor cores have become more powerful, so performance has marched upward. However, in 2018, the desktop processor lineup that will be suitable for Apple's iMac systems, which goes by the name Coffee Lake, will feature up to six processor cores -- a 50% jump in core count from current offerings. What this will mean to Mac buyers An increase in core count should enable better performance in processor-intensive applications such as audio and video editing, and it should make multi-tasking smoother, especially with multiple processor intensive programs running in parallel. The average consumer might not view more processor cores as a potential selling point, as the average consumer probably just buys a new system when his or her current system breaks or becomes too slow. However, what I think this might do is shift some prosumers or professional users away from entry-level configurations of Apple's Mac Pro, which can be configured with processors with six or more processor cores, and toward higher-end iMac models. An iMac with a six core processors isn't going to be a suitable replacement for the Mac Pro in all use cases -- there's still a lot of stuff that Apple adds to the Mac Pro that would be tough to get into an all-in-one form factor, such as dual graphics cards. However, I suspect that for a non-trivial subset of potential Mac Pro buyers -- admittedly a small group to begin with -- the case for the Mac Pro will become tougher to make when 2018 rolls around, especially if Apple doesn't bother to update the Mac Pro soon.  Apple will need to update the Mac Pro to keep it relevant Apple hasn't updated the Mac Pro in years. The current Mac Pro systems use Intel's Ivy Bridge-EP processors, which first made their debut in the latter half of 2013. Since then, the chipmaker has released not one but two successors to the Ivy Bridge-EP chips, Haswell-EP and then Broadwell-EP. The Apple Mac Pro. Image source: Apple.  And, in mid-2017, Intel is expected to release the successor to Broadwell-EP, known as Skylake-EP. It's not clear why Apple hasn't bothered to update this system. Perhaps Apple doesn't sell enough of them to justify the R&D investment to refresh the lineup rapidly. But if the company wants to keep this product line relevant, updating it sooner rather than later and then committing to keeping the systems fresh as new components arrive would be a good idea.

Easing the waiting pain, HEXUS thoroughly tested an early 14nm+ Core i7-7700K sample from Intel early this month. Unfortunately, the improvements evident over Skylake processors left quite a few readers underwhelmed. On a positive note we noted the potential headroom for overclocking thanks to the reworking of the 14nm process. In tests our sample clocked up to 4.85GHz on air, stable and considered suitable for long-term usage. Normality Enthusiasts with early access have had several weeks of tinker time to push the limits of these 7th generation processors. While HEXUS considers overclocking potential for long term practical usage in your apps and games, OC enthusiasts have no such shackles. Professional OC athlete Allen 'Splave' Golibersuch used common tricks such as disabling cores and hyperthreading, using LN2 cooling, and very high voltages to squeeze the maximum clock speed from the Core i7-7700K sample inhis rig. 7GHz+ As reported by OCLab, via TechPowerUp, Splave achieved a bench-stable 7022.96MHz on his Core i7-7700K sample. To dial up this clock speed the chip's maximum multiplier of 69x was used with a base-clock of 101.78MHz, resulting in the headline 7GHz+. Chip core voltage was tweaked up to 2.00V. Benchmark results were as follows: it completed the PiFast benchmark in 9.02 seconds, SuperPi 32M in 4 minutes 20.25 seconds, wPrime 32M in 2.953 seconds, and wPrime 1024M in 1 minute 33.171 seconds. Splave equipped an ASUS GeForce GTX 1080 STRIX OC graphics card for further benchmarks and scored 643,316 points in Aquamark, and 86,798 points in 3DMark05. All OCs and tests were conducted on an ASRock Z170M OC Formula motherboard.

By George Koo December 27, 2016 9:07 PM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Asia Times is not responsible for the opinions, facts or any media content presented by contributors. In case of abuse, click here to report. The Trump transition team recently announced the appointment of Peter Navarro to a newly created post as the head of newly created National Trade Council. Apparently this appointment will not require a Senate hearing and confirmation. Thus a lightweight could be rewarded for his loyalty and not risk embarrassing the new administration. On the other hand, Trump could be seriously considering Navarro as his point person in trade negotiations with China. Either way, the possible involvement of Navarro on the most important bilateral relations of the world deserves serious analysis. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox At one time, Navarro tried his hand at politics and ran for US Congress, mayor and city council. Each time he came up empty—a many-time loser. Then he became a lame pundit who concentrated his vitriol on China mixed with questionable reasoning in economics. As one indicator, Navarro chose Gordon G. Chang to write the forward to his recent book on China’s militarism. Chang was the pundit who predicted the collapse of China in 2001, only to see China’s economy double and then double again. Navarro came to Chang’s rescue by blaming the Clinton Administration for letting China into the WTO and thus supposedly prevented Chang’s forecast of doom from coming true. Then Navarro expressed his unreserved admiration for Harry Wu because Wu was a willing talking head in Navarro’s video interviews. Since his death, Wu’s sordid past of lying, stealing other people’s money and cheating on his wife have come to light. Until Trump’s appointment, that’s the kind of company Navarro kept. Apparently, he came to Trump’s attention when he said 4-5% GDP growth is possible under Trump’s administration, even while imposing import duties on goods made in China. If that’s really so, the economic growth would have to be increasing at better than twice the historic rate associated with a good year. The simple but erroneous idea is that import tariff will protect jobs in the domestic market. It simply doesn’t work that way. It’s unbecoming for a Harvard PhD economist, like Navarro, to say so. Ronald Reagan tried to protect America’s auto industry A fairly recent example that comes to mind was when Reagan wanted to protect the American auto industry by imposing an import duty on cars made in Japan. The idea was to give the US carmakers breathing space to become more competitive. Instead of taking advantage of the import barrier to work on their competitiveness, the US car companies simply took advantage of the new prices for imported Japanese cars by raising their own sticker price. It was only after the Japanese makers transferred their plants into the US—and thus avoided the import duty—that the American companies began the serious task of having to compete. In effect, the import duty “protected” by allowing the American companies to remain inefficient. Only after the Japanese carmakers built their plants in the US that the American companies had to trim their workforce to compete. And by the way, the workforce that went to work for the Japanese carmakers were non-union and got lower pay. Imposing import duty across the board on goods made in China would be wrong-headed and even more disastrous than asking the American consumer to pay more for their cars. Most of the consumer goods made in China such as apparel, shoes, toys, and hardware haven’t been made in America in decades. There are no domestic industries to protect and the import tax would just add the daily cost of living for every American. American companies did not establish plants in China just for low cost labor but also to serve a growing local market there. The personal computer is an illustrative example. The PC used to be assembled in Taiwan and then the Taiwanese companies moved to the mainland because of the significant savings in labor. Economic pressures forced their component suppliers to follow them. Component suppliers for the PC came from Japan, Korea, Taiwan as well as the US. Intel combined its China and US manufacturing to stay competitive One of the US suppliers was Intel. They first set up an integrated circuit assembly and test plant in Chengdu to perform the final manufacturing steps on the microprocessors made in the US. The finished ICs were then shipped to the PC makers all over China. Gradually as China became a major consumer of PCs, Intel expanded their operations in China, not only at Chengdu but also added a semiconductor fab operations in Dalian. However, even today Intel continues to make 75% of their semiconductor chips in their US operations even as 75% of their market is outside of the US. Intel’s total US manufacturing payroll is much higher than its payroll for their Chengdu operation, even though the number of workers employed in Chengdu is “orders of magnitude” bigger than the number engaged in the US—according to my source inside Intel. The explanation is that the US manufacturing steps are technology intensive and highly automated. Not many workers are required but each has to be highly trained and very well paid. The Chengdu operations involving test and packaging require many workers, but each does not have to be highly technical nor highly paid. Taking advantage of the comparative advantage (that’s jargon from Econ 101) of each place gives Intel the means to maintain their technical dominance over their competition. This is nothing to do with currency manipulation, just simple economics. Most of the American companies that set up operations in China may have the low cost labor in mind initially but subsequently justified added investments because China had become a huge market in its own right. In some cases, China did impose import duty on foreign made products and thus encouraged the American companies to operate inside China—just as Reagan’s import duty encourage Japan’s auto makers to move into the US. In the end, the local investment benefited the foreign investor, but also China’s economy with a more skilled workforce. The same could apply in the reverse, i.e., as regards to China’s investments coming into the US. Chinese companies are looking to invest in the US to be closer to the major markets here. They certainly wouldn’t be looking for lower cost of labor but would be paying higher salary for more technically demanding jobs. This could only benefit the local economy in the US. Xenophobia and stupidity should not discourage these investments just because they are from China. Navarro makes no bones about demonizing China in everything he has said, but is he really compatible with Donald Trump’s real personal interests? Last month, a video of Trump’s granddaughter Arabella Kushner reciting a poem in Chinese won the hearts of millions of Chinese. This suggests that Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, understand the importance of learning Chinese for their 5-year old daughter’s future. Surely they have more influence on Ivanka’s father than Navarro? Sheldon Adelson has been one of Trump’s major supporters. His billions of net worth is tied to majority ownership of Las Vegas Sands and more than 60% of revenue and profits of the company is derived from Macau. He could hardly be pleased if Trump were to deliberately raise the tension between the US and China. China exercises its international influence far differently from the American way of relying on military alliances. Close to 100 countries have China as their largest trading partner. Among them, some 60 plus are also members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or are recipients of AIIB investments. Their relationship with China is based on common economic interests. The Trump Administration should also consider the merits of developing a bilateral relations based on shared economic interest. Bilateral basis for common economic interest Consider for example the economic benefits of tourism from China to the US Last year, less than 3% of China’s total outbound tourists came to the US and they spent over US$30 billion. That was the first full year when the Chinese were granted 10-year, multi-entry visas to visit the US. The future impact of Chinese tourists on the American economy will continue to grow exponentially, provided of course that the US and China are not engaged in some mano a mano test of military armament. There are over 330,000 Chinese students studying in the US in the academic year just past. According to the Department of Commerce, these students contributed US$11.4 billion to help prop up the finances of the US universities as well as the local economy. Not to be overlooked another benefit of these students is that as much as 75% of the graduates would prefer to stay and work in the US if the US would permit. China produces many more times graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics than the US can produce. They are just the talent pool American companies desperately need to keep their plants operating and not having to move them offshore. Trump has to understand that America is losing jobs to automation and technological advances and not to China. Someday, for example, Uber is going to rely of self-drive cars and all the drivers will have to find another job. Amazon will use drones to deliver their packages and UPS will have to either operate the drones or else find some other line of work. Encouraging the employment of Chinese graduates will buy Trump time to figure out how to save high paying jobs that will stay ahead of the technology evolution. America’s future lies in generating highly qualified and skilled workers and not in bringing back low paying jobs from overseas. Thus, we hope that Trump will have the wisdom to look for the win-win approach with China. To promote Navarro’s line of military confrontation and restart the nuclear race can only lead to a lose-lose outcome and such outcomes would be devastating beyond imagination.

We get it, Baba Ramdev has managed to market himself in a way that has made the word his brand. In the technology world, Lenovo has managed to carve a unique niche for itself with its “Yoga” line-up of flexible machines, so much so that a new Yoga release manages to drum up some great hype! So, is the Lenovo Yoga 510 worth the hype? The review unit that we received was the black colour variant with the following specs: Processor: Intel i5 7200 @ 2.5GHz Display: 14 inch Full HD IPS LCD touch Panel RAM: 4 GB Storage: 1 TB GPU: ATI Radeon R5 M430 and Intel HD Graphics 620 Battery: 2 Cell 39WH, rated for up to five hours Design Over the last few years, Lenovo has managed to crank out some nice designs for its laptop range, The Yoga 510 is not an exception. The machine looks classy and suave, while it is not going grab your attention from across the room, there is an understated appeal to one when you hold it in your hands. The shiny silver ring around the chassis on the black one, for instance is one of the many subtle touches that Lenovo has managed to pack into the design. The way the chassis moves outwards in straight lines across the edges is another or the lid which slopes downward from the edges. In Fact, the lid and the bottom portion of the laptop never truly meet when closed, which subtly hints at the fact, that there is more to this machine than simply being laptop for you to lug around. If I were forced to say one bad thing about the design, it’s the fact that you can’t open the lid, one handed, the hinge mechanism is solid but also weirdly feels springy at times, in my attempts to open the lid one handed, I almost always lifted the machine clean off the table, sometimes this happened right when I had the lid half open, meaning it will just shut close and slip from my finger. It isn’t a huge issue though; it was something I could get used to quickly. The keyboard is well spaced and the keys have a satisfying click when you type, if I were to knit-pick, I would say that the Caps Lock button is placed far too close to the “A” key for comfort, so it isn’t uncommon to suddenly go “ALL CAPS RAGE” in a chat window. The trackpad is big and spacious and importantly, there is a sizeable amount of space between it and the keyboard, which is appreciated, especially for those with big fingers. As the name implies, the machines flexibility allows it to morph between four different modes, Laptop mode is the common notebook mode, Tablet allows you to fold the Keyboard away behind the screen, doing so disables the keyboard/trackpad to prevent accidental inputs which is great but I found I used this mode the least, partly because I was always worried I would knock some keys off from the keyboard while it was folded, Stand mode is a sort of hybrid tablet mode, instead of folding the keyboard away behind the screen, you keep it face down on the surface (Gulp!), while the screen stays perpendicular and Tent mode allows you to pitch the machine in a “A” shaped position. In my use, I found that I used Tent and laptop the most out of the modes, mainly because I never felt comfortable having the keyboard folded away at the back of the screen or lying face down on a surface. Don’t get me wrong, this is not a knock against the design, the hinge is solid, throughout my use, it never gave me any problems but I just couldn’t help but get nervous when I felt the keys on the back while in tablet mode or knowing that the keyboard is face-down on a surface in stand mode. Performance The 510 is unfortunately, a rather inconsistent performer. Sometimes the machine took so long to boot up, I thought there was something wrong and would try to hit the power button, other times it would boot up but take so long to load up background services that you would sit and stare at the wallpaper because nothing would register on the screen except the movements of your frustrated mouse pointer. The times it did work, the 510 is snappy but not in a way that is going to other machines in its class a complex, there is sometimes a noticeable delay in what you type and it appearing on the screen, there were times when I would type a sentence and find that the cursor hadn’t moved past the first letter, only to have the rest of the text appear in a flash, completing the sentence. The one area that the 510 absolutely shines in though, is the screen. It’s bright, vibrant and captures detail well. Watching a film was a very pleasant experience on this machine. The Harman branded speaker system is also very good, they exceed the standards of other laptop speakers in the same price point, unfortunately these are down firing, meaning they are located at the bottom of the machine. Thankfully, this is one area where the 510’s Flex ability comes in great handy. In fact, I was surprised at the amount of times I did use 510’s yoga prowess, after being sceptical initially. There are practical uses for all the added shape shifting abilities. Another neat thing was the fact that the machine lasted me five hours on a charge on about fifty percent brightness and moderate use. Under heavy use, it lasted four. We were about to finish two movies on a single charge with the brightness turned up to one hundred percent. Conclusion The Lenovo Yoga 510 is an odd case, it has the makings of a classic, a great design, fantastic screen, great trackpad and keyboard, decent battery life…On paper, it has the makings to be a fantastic machine, unfortunately, none of these come together to form a cohesive whole due to the inconsistent performance. At a price starting at rupees sixty thousand, it’s a tough pill to swallow.

Credit: Tej3478 More like this Google needs solid win with release of smart Allo app AWS comes out swinging with A.I. services Why Google A.I. is the last user interface Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware For artificial intelligence, 2016 has been a big year. After years of researchers saying artificial intelligence (A.I.) was on the cusp of a revolution, the technology has made major advances this past year. And now, finally, the beginnings of that major A.I. revolution seem to be here. "It's been a huge year in A.I.," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. "We've seen industry giants -- like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia -- either make A.I. their company 'north star' or add and advance the craft with new offerings to democratize A.I." In this past year, the land grab for anything A.I. was one of the most noticeable aspects of this industry. For instance, in this past year alone, at least 20 artificial intelligence companies have been acquired, according to CB Insights, a tech market analysis company. In 2016, Apple acquired Emotient, Tuplejump, and Turi, while Salesforce bought PredictionIQ and MetaMind; Google picked up Api.ai and Moodstocks; and Intel acquired Itseez, Nervana Systems and Movidius. Twitter, eBay, Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, and GE also acquired A.I. companies. Some of the companies getting scooped up were startups, meaning the big companies were often as interested in the A.I. researchers as much as the technology they were working on. That's because big players in, and out, of the tech industry see the writing on the wall. A.I. is going to be a big player, whether it's being used to help customers pick out the perfect jacket online, or give them directions around an accident on their commute home, find fraudulent action on client accounts, or interact with clients and customers using voice commands, text, and chat apps. Executives at online retailer 1-800-Flowers, for instance, say artificial intelligence technology is so important that it will completely change their business. "We are on the cusp of a change as big as when e-commerce hit," said Chris McCann, president and CEO of 1-800-Flowers.com, in an interview this fall. "It's giving us the opportunity to have such deep relationships with our customers that it'll be like the company hasn't existed before." This past May, Google showed how focused it is on A.I. during its annual Google I/O developers conference, unveiling A.I.-powered products like Google Assistant, its Google Home device, the Allo chat app and the Duo video chat app. And this past October, IBM president and CEO Ginni Rometty said during a keynote at the company's World of Watson conference that in the next five years, every major decision -- personal or business -- will be made with the help of IBM's Watson A.I. system. A statement like that takes a lot of confidence in advances coming in the technology. "We are about where I expected we'd be in the industry but, be aware, this is a moving bar and one big breakthrough could change this dynamic dramatically. And there are a lot of people in the hunt for that breakthrough," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group. "Next year, we'll see a lot more smart systems, an increasingly capable group of smart assistants and far more self-driving, and even self-flying, vehicles being tested." In other words, in the coming year artificial intelligence advances may begin to cascade, instead of simply inch forward. And A.I. itself could begin to fuel that progress. "Right now, A.I. is largely being created by humans," said Enderle. "The big wave will likely come when A.I. systems are more aggressively used to create future A.I. systems. When that happens, the speed of advancement will likely follow less of a linear scale and more of an algorithmic one." For Moorhead, he thinks 2017 will see an increasing number of companies using artificial intelligence-based platforms in their apps and services. "I also think we will start to see enterprises jumping onto the A.I. bandwagon," he added. "I expect the Tesla full autonomous car capabilities will be close to be turned on... I don't believe we're yet at the tipping point [with A.I.] but we are close. The tipping point will likely happen next year as A.I. makes its way into more apps." Dave Schubmehl, an analyst with IDC, said he too expects to see more enterprises adopting A.I. technologies in the coming year. "I think we'll see a significant increase in the distribution and use of A.I. that is embedded within enterprise applications, providing guidance, recommendations, and predictions," he said. "I think we're on track as far as what we're seeing in the marketplace." Schubmehl, however, said while there have been strong advances in conversational A.I. systems, he's disappointed there haven't been more advances in consumer-focused digital assistants. Moorhead, agreed, adding, "Intelligent agents, like Alexa and Siri, are behind where I thought they'd be." They're hoping, though, that 2017 will see that turn around.

Mesa Hit OpenGL 4.5, Received Vulkan Drivers, Improved Performance & More In 2016 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 27 December 2016 at 06:24 AM EST. Add A Comment Almost any longtime Linux user or Phoronix reader will surely agree with me that Mesa absolutely rocked this year for the open-source graphics stack. This year Mesa finally hit OpenGL 4.5 compliance (along with OpenGL 4.3/4.4 before that), received its first Vulkan drivers via Intel ANV and the unofficial Radeon RADV code, saw many significant performance improvements throughout core Mesa and the hardware drivers, seen improvements to NIR and other core areas of Mesa, saw AMD Polaris support in RadeonSI at launch, the OpenSWR software rasterizer was merged, various improvements to the Gallium3D state trackers like for video acceleration and D3D9, and so much more. For reminiscing over Mesa's hell of a year, here's a look at the most popular Mesa articles on Phoronix in 2016 of our over 200 original articles about the Mesa3D project this year: BioShock Infinite Can Run More Than 23% Faster With New RadeonSI Patches Marek Olšák at AMD continues optimizing the RadeonSI Gallium3D driver for offering much better Linux gaming performance when using this open-source AMD graphics driver code. The latest are double-digit gains for at least the BioShock Infinite game. RadeonSI Patches For Compiling Optimized Shader Variants Asynchronously AMD developer Marek Olšák pushed his latest RadeonSI Gallium3D patch series into Mesa Git a few hours ago for further improving the open-source Radeon OpenGL driver stack. Mesa 12.0 RC4 Released, Mesa 12 Officially Coming Soon Emil Velikov announced the release this morning of the fourth and final planned release candidate for Mesa 12.0. Mesa 11.2 Features For When It's Released Very Soon Besides Linux 4.5 expected this weekend, the release of Mesa 11.2 is also imminent. AMD Polaris Support Lands In Mesa's RadeonSI Gallium3D Driver While AMD just open-sourced their next-gen Polaris graphics driver code this week, changes have already landed in LLVM and this morning the Mesa/Gallium3D modifications necessary have landed in mainline Mesa. The 12 Big New Features Of Mesa 12.0 With Mesa 12 now having been branched with plans to release next month, the code is under a feature freeze as developers turn to fixing bugs ahead of this stable release. With no more major features planned, here's an overview of the new features for Mesa 12.0. Latest Mesa Update Lands In Ubuntu 16.04, Enables OpenGL 4.1 With LLVM 3.8 In the process of landing in the Ubuntu 16.04 "Xenial Xerus" package archive is the newly-minted Mesa 11.1.2. While a point release update for Ubuntu of Mesa isn't usually noteworthy, with this change they are also building against LLVM 3.8 to allow OpenGL 4.1 support for the RadeonSI Gallium3D driver. OpenGL 4.5 Is Not The End Of The Road For OpenGL Particularly after writing about OpenGL 4 progress in Mesa, it's quite common to see comments in our forums and elsewhere about people thinking when "Mesa is done" or how "OpenGL 4.5 is the last major release" or "Vulkan makes OpenGL dead", etc. Mesa & AMDGPU-PRO Appear To Run Fine With Rocket League On Linux With many Linux gamers having looked forward to the Linux release of Rocket League, I tested out the Linux port of the game when using Mesa RadeonSI Gallium3D as well as the AMDGPU-PRO blob. Mesa 11.2.1 Released For Stable Users Of Open-Source Linux GPU Drivers Mesa 11.2.1 is now available as the first maintenance release for Mesa 11.2. Much Faster MSAA Anti-Aliasing Is Coming For R600g/RadeonSI Marek Olšák posted a patch today to significantly boost the performance for games using multi-sample anti-aliasing (MSAA) on both the R600g and RadeonSI Gallium3D drivers. Core Mesa Is Now Just One Step Away From OpenGL 4.3 Compliance Mesa is now very close to OpenGL 4.3 compliance thanks to a massive patch series that was posted today for review. Intel's Mesa Driver Now Enables OpenGL 4.5 Intel's Mesa OpenGL driver now officially enables OpenGL 4.5 support for Broadwell "Gen 8" hardware and newer. Radeon GL Threading Work Leads To 70% Speed Boost In At Least One Game Expert Mesa developer Marek Olšák at AMD is spending this weekend hacking on some new OpenGL threading code to benefit the open-source Radeon Linux driver stack. Marek Continues Baking More Mesa Optimizations AMD developer Marek Olšák continues leading their recent charge on looking to boost the performance potential out of Mesa / Gallium3D. Marek Has Taken To Improving Mesa's GLSL Compiler Performance With catching up on the OpenGL extensions, Marek Olšák of AMD has been spending a fair amount of time on performance optimizations for the AMD's open-source OpenGL driver and some code that benefits Mesa as a whole too. One of his latest patch series is on optimizing Mesa's GLSL compiler performance. These 17 Patches Effectively Put Intel Mesa Done With OpenGL 4.4 & 4.5 Timothy Arceri sent out the latest version of his Intel Mesa patches for the ARB_enhanced_layouts OpenGL extension. These patches finish up this last GL extension that's needed by this open-source Intel Linux driver before it can claim OpenGL 4.4 and then 4.5 compliance. Getting Started With Mesa Development This Weekend It seems more and more independent developers are interested in getting involved in Mesa open-source graphics driver development, but aren't really sure where to start or what are some easy tasks to get started. Features You Will Not Find In The Mesa 13.0 Release While Mesa 13.0 is coming along for release next month with exciting features like OpenGL 4.5 for Intel, unofficial GL 4.4/4.5 for RadeonSI/NVC0, and the addition of the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver, there is some functionality that sadly won't be found in this release. BioShock Infinite Runs Much Faster For RadeonSI On Mesa Git: ~40% Earlier this week the deferred flushes change landed in Radeon Gallium3D code for reportedly offering 23%+ performance improvements in BioShock Infinite as one example. I've tested out BioShock Infinite and other changes to confirm the performance differences.

Intel will be able to make a lean, efficient x86 architecture that will compete with AMD's nearly-here Zen architecture. What I'm taking away from this is that AMD will be ahead of the game for a few years until Intel can get their act together with a new architecture to begin competing against the star-studded launch of Zen.

The board was announced in August but didn't ship right away. The Joule 550x is a full-fledged computer on a small circuit board, and it packs more horsepower and graphics capabilities than the Raspberry Pi 3. But at prices of up to US$349, the Joule 550x costs about 10 times more than Raspberry Pi 3. The board is now available from online retailer Mouser. It is available for $291 on Newegg. Intel's recommended price for Joule 550x is $149 to $159, so Mouser is asking for a heavy premium for the computer board. The Joule 550x will provide ample computing power to people building powerful robots, drones, or electronics. Using boards available before the retail release, some Joule-based robots and devices, like Microsoft's voice recognizing Bamboo robot, have already been made, and others like bartending robots are on the way. The board also has the computing power to be used as a Linux PC, and it has integrated graphics, memory, storage and Wi-Fi on board. A virtual reality headset can also be built with the Joule 550x. The Joule 550x is a watered down version of Intel's Joule 570x board, which has a faster processor and more memory. The Intel board beats Raspberry Pi 3 on features. The Joule 550x has a quad-core Atom T5500 processor based on the Broxton chip architecture, 8GB of storage, 3GB of LPDDR4 memory, two USB 3.0 ports, dual-antenna 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. It also has the usual interfaces like I2S, GPIO, and UART found on popular development boards. The computer can be used to make IoT devices and supports major operating systems like embedded Linux and Windows 10 IoT Core. Raspberry Pi 3 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410c also support major OSes. While consumer-focused robots are cool, Intel hopes the usage of Joule expands in the enterprise. Powerful graphics capabilities are needed for tasks like product inspection. The processing capabilities of such a board could also to automate engineering tasks. Intel ultimately hopes to increase shipments of IoT chips after abandoning Atom chips in the mobile and tablet markets.

The company has established an amazingly modest set of minimum hardware requirements for upcoming VR headsets to be used with PCs. Microsoft believes mixed reality is the future of computing and wants to bring VR as many PCs as possible. The requirements for Windows 10 PCs for tethered VR headsets do not apply to fully integrated headset computers like Microsoft's HoloLens. Companies like Dell, HP, Acer, Asus, and Lenovo plan to come out with headset accessories for PCs, and Microsoft has said prices for those VR headsets would start at US$299. Microsoft's requirements are much lower than those for the high-end HTC Vive and Oculus Rift headsets, which require top-class GPUs and CPUs. By comparison, Microsoft's minimum hardware requirements make space to plug low-end VR headsets into PCs for movie watching, casual gaming, and basic applications. The specifications are just a starting point, but the more loaded a computer, the better the VR experience will get, Mingfei Yan, senior program manager at Microsoft, said during a presentation at last week's WinHEC show in Shenzhen, China. To support a VR headset right now, a laptop will need to have the equivalent of Intel's Core i5 7200U CPU based on Kaby Lake, Intel's HD 620 integrated graphics, and 8GB of dual-channel memory. The hardware requirements get a bit more demanding next year, when Microsoft releases its Creators Update for Windows 10, which is built around 3D gaming, virtual reality, and 4K movies. There's a bit more flexibility in the CPU requirements, but a computer may need a discrete or powerful integrated GPU. For Creators Update, the minimum laptop requirement will be an Intel Core i5 chip -- Microsoft provided the example of a Skylake-based Core i5 6200U. The laptop GPU will need to be an Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M, AMD RX460, or DirectX 12-compatible GPU. A desktop will require a minimum of a Core i3 or an AMD FX4530 CPU equivalent, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 960/1050, AMD Radeon RX460, or a DirectX 12 compatible GPU. PCs will also require a minimum of 8GB of dual-channel RAM and more than 10GB of storage. Additionally, PCs should have HDMI 1.4 for 60Hz head-mounted displays and HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort for 90Hz VR headset displays. Alternately, a PC could have or USB 3.0 Type-A or USB 3.1 Type-C port with DisplayPort Alternate mode. Other specs include Bluetooth 4.0 wireless connection for accessories like controllers. Faster storage like SSDs and DDR4 memory will provide a better VR experience. AMD's mobile chips are still being tested for the specification, Yan said. Microsoft is using tracking technology to establish a "safety zone" to allow people to move when roaming VR worlds or playing games. Microsoft will prompt users to set up an active space in which to move, with the goal for VR users to avoiding crashing into furniture or other objects. Ultimately, Microsoft hopes VR headsets will be able to communicate with PCs wirelessly. That will provide users with more freedom to roam around larger areas, Yan said. The company also believes audio will play an important role when interacting with 3D worlds via a VR headset. For example, Cortana could be an important feature for VR apps in Windows 10. For the VR headset, Yan recommended putting in dual microphones, a headphone jack, or an audio array so users can enable the Cortana experience. By the next Creators Update, Microsoft will support Universal Windows Platform apps on its mixed reality platform. Microsoft's Edge browser will have VR capabilities with support for the WebVR standard. Microsoft's goal is to provide the largest catalog of apps and content for VR headsets, Yan said. The company will add new a movie and TV catalog with the Creators Update as a one-stop shop for videos that can run on VR headsets. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The CEO resigned in February, layoffs followed in the next month, and the cloud of a takeover hung over the company with rumored negotiations to purchase the company. The company is best known as a provider of PowerVR GPUs for Apple's iPhone and the MIPS CPU architecture, which competes with Intel's X86 and ARM. Imagination has its eyes set on a strong 2017 by taking an approach much like Intel did last year and refocusing on areas of growth, which include graphics and the internet of things. Imagination next year will release new PowerVR and MIPS chip designs, with the goal of driving growth in those areas. Imagination is following the path set by chip companies ARM and Intel, which have refocused their business around IoT. The chip designer has seen success in areas like set-top boxes, automotive tech, and networking, and it will continue to focus on those areas. But Imagination has the assets to succeed in emerging areas like virtual reality, and its technologies are already being used in VR headsets. Chip design business model Imagination has a business model similar to ARM's: It designs chips and licenses the designs to companies. Next year, Imagination will release the new Series8XT graphics processor, which will be targeted at a range of devices, including high-end phones and VR headsets. Apple, which is a minority shareholder in Imagination, could be one company licensing the Series8XT GPU. Apple tweaked the previous Series7XT used in the iPhone 7 and has used PowerVR technology in all iPhones to date. Imagination also wants to regain share in the mobile market as it expands the Series8XE graphics processor into low-end and mid-range phones, said Graham Deacon, senior director of business operations for PowerVR. That's a market Imagination has lost, with competitive GPUs from ARM and Qualcomm taking share. Imagination introduced Series8XE earlier this year, and the technology is reaching low- and mid-range devices. The goal is for Series8XT to be a harbinger of many new technologies, but all the GPUs will cram in more performance, Deacon said. New opportunities The PowerVR GPUs could find a place in infotainment systems and autonomous cars. There's a fair amount of research being done to tweak the GPUs for machine learning, Deacon said. There's also an opportunity in artificial intelligence, and Imagination is developing technologies and algorithms to tap into artificial intelligence uses, Deacon said. Imagination also plans to release new MIPS CPUs in the next year. MIPS CPUs have lost market share to ARM and Intel in the IoT market, but interest remains in the CPU architecture for cars, data centers, networking, and IoT devices. The company's strategy is to go after the massive volume opportunity in IoT and networking, rather than go after mobile application processors, said Steve Evans, vice president for business operations at MIPS. ARM has dominated the mobile device market in recent years. Intel recently quit making mobile CPUs, and MIPS hasn't found success. Only a handful of mobile handsets and tablets have used MIPS CPUs. But MIPS survives in other markets. Mobileye, which develops autonomous driving systems for cars, already uses MIPS CPUs. There are also many IoT devices, like low-speed LTE modems from Sequans and Altair, using MIPS CPUs. The company is also pitching the MIPS CPU for robots, drones, and other industrial applications. MIPS CPUs are also being used in wearables, particularly products developed in China. Imagination has targeted the MIPS CPU at servers in the past but with little success. But the fastest I6500-class CPU is comparable to the top-line ARM processor and is doing well, Evans said. While main CPUs in servers may be based on x86, there's interest for MIPS CPUs in the data-plane element, and companies like Broadcom and Cavium are making networking processors based on MIPS. Drones and robots Combining PowerVR and MIPS could provide a powerful chip combination for drones and robots. MIPS can provide the multi-core processing power, while PowerVR will provide the visual computing element, Imagination executives said. As the company looks to diversify into new markets, the cloud of getting acquired will hang over their head. But it's a public company with multiple shareholders, and it will continue focusing on what it does and won't be distracted, said David Harold, a company spokesman.

For every blue screen of death, there are droves of technological enhancements driving PCs into the era of virtual reality, 4K video and 5G connectivity. Here are the top 10 PC technology and trends to watch next year. VR PCs on your head Intel/IDGNS An Intel employee demonstrates the company's Project Alloy headset on stage during IDF 2016 in San Francisco on August 16, 2016. VR devices will come in many new shapes and sizes, with some of them acting essentially as PCs that fit on your head. Dell, Asus, Acer, Lenovo and HP will release mixed reality headsets, which will allow users to interact with 3D objects that pop up as floating images superimposed on a real-life background. The devices will provide a new level of human-computer interaction, making it more fun than ever to create 3D objects, play games, watch moves, and have interactive Skype calls. These "holographic computers," as they have been called, will have Intel chips, an integrated GPU and possibly a 3D RealSense camera to identify objects, measure distances, and provide new perspectives on surroundings. Storage prices will go up Martyn Williams A computer with an Intel SSD on display at Computex 2015 in Taipei Prices of SSDs are going up due to shortages, and that could have an impact on the price of laptops, 2-in-1 computers and storage. Dell's XPS 13 with Intel's Kaby Lake chips and a 512GB SSD, for example, is not available right now.  Other laptops with 512GB SSDs are priced unbelievably high. Most PC makers are offering 128GB or 256GB SSDs in PCs by default. Choose storage wisely, as it isn't easy to screw open a superthin 2-in-1 to replace an SSD. Talk to your PC Microsoft Woman using Microsoft's Cortana voice-activated assistant on Lumia smartphone. The feud between Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana voice-activated assistants could get more interesting next year. Users will be able to shout out Cortana commands to Windows 10 PCs from a longer distance, thanks to a "far-field speech recognition" technology that Intel and Microsoft are working on. Until now, Cortana worked best if a user was close to a PC, but millions of Windows PCs will turn into Amazon Echo competitors with this new feature. Cortana can do a lot more than Amazon Echo, like accessing information from the cloud, chatting with chatbots, checking email and other tasks. AMD ratchets up chip battle with Intel Martyn Williams Intel has been the unchallenged king of PCs for more than a decade, but AMD is fighting back with its new Ryzen PC processor, which will reaches PCs next year. A healthy rivalry will be good news for PC users, some of whom may jump from the Intel to the AMD camp. AMD claims Ryzen is 40 percent faster than its current PC chips, which on paper is impressive. The chips will first hit gaming PCs, and then mainstream laptops and desktops later in 2017. Ryzen will battle Intel's Kaby Lake in early 2017, and the 10-nanometer Cannonlake in late 2017. ARM-based laptops with Windows, again Stephen Lawson The first attempt at ARM PCs, which ran on Windows RT, was an unmitigated disaster, and it left many users skeptical of the idea. But Microsoft hasn't given up, especially as 5G starts to become a reality and cellular connectivity in PCs becomes essential. Microsoft announced that next year PCs will be available with Qualcomm's ARM-based Snapdragon 835, which is primarily for smartphones. Super-thin laptops will get integrated modems and a long battery life with the chip. The ARM-based PCs will run Win32 applications that run on regular x86 PCs via emulation. For now, no PC maker has announced ARM-based Windows PCs -- manufacturers  may be cautious in light of the Windows RT fiasco. There are also many challenges. Snapdragon isn't as fast as high-end x86 Intel or AMD chips, and won't support 64-bit applications initially. Also, emulation may limit the ability to exploit hardware acceleration. Bluetooth 5 will take charge Stephen Lawson The Bluetooth logo. Laptops and 2-in-1s will be equipped with the latest Bluetooth 5 wireless specification, which is a longer and faster upgrade to the aging Bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 will allow PCs to communicate wirelessly with devices up to 400 meters away in clear line of sight, but a more reasonable range is about 120 meters, according to analysts.  Bluetooth 5 will transfer data at speeds of up to 2Mbps, which is two times faster than its predecessor. Beautiful screens, 4K and HDR Dell Dell's XPS 13 has an edge-to-edge screen. Laptops like the XPS 13 and Lenovo's Yoga 910 have beautiful edge-to-edge screens, a feature that may be included in more laptops next year. Also, 4K screens and HDR (high-dynamic range) technology will make games and movies look stunning. HDR results in more vivid images, and TVs, cameras and monitors supporting the technology are already available. Netflix is also doubling down on HDR. An HDR standards battle is brewing with DolbyVision and HBR3, but GPU makers are supporting both standards. AMD expects DolbyVision to ultimately win. New storage and memory technologies Intel 3D XPoint is the technology behind Optane products. Intel's Optane, a superfast SSD and DRAM replacement that could ultimately unify memory and storage, could cause a radical change in PC architecture. But that won't happen for a few years, and the initial expectations for Optane are modest. The first Optane SSDs will be in enthusiast PCs, and could cost a small fortune. Optane SSDs have been measured as being 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. Over time, Optane could replace DRAM DIMMs, with the added advantage of being able to store data. The SSDs won't be in laptops next year as the technology's uses are still being explored. Optane is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, which Intel co-developed with Micron. SSDs based on Micron's 3D XPoint technology will ship next year under the QuantX brand. More changes for keyboards Lenovo Lenovo's Yoga Book has a virtual keyboard on a touch panel. We saw some interesting changes to keyboards this year: Apple added the Touch Bar, while Lenovo swapped out the hard keyboard for a virtual keyboard on a touch input panel for its Yoga Book. Lenovo wants to bring the virtual keyboard to more Chromebooks and 2-in-1s, partly because of its versatility. The touch input panel can also be used to draw or take notes with a stylus. It's a toss-up: Lenovo believes that those used to typing on mobile devices will adapt to this touch panel keyboard quickly, while hard keyboard diehards will dismiss the idea. Some ports won't go away easily James Niccolai USB Type-C cable on show at CES PC makers may not muster up the courage to remove the headphone jack and SD card slots from PCs right away, but USB 2.0 slots could be on their way out. Some PC makers may leave out display and other legacy ports with the emergence of the versatile USB Type-C, which can be used to charge PCs and connect displays, storage devices and other peripherals.

Support for Ubuntu 16.04 desktop OS has been added to the Joule board, according to developer notes for Intel IoT Developer Kit 5.0 released late last week. Intel has two Joule boards: the 570x, which sells for $219 on Mouser, and the 550x, which is priced at $179 on the same retail site. The 550x, which started shipping recently, was priced at $349 until Monday, but was cut in half after a story by the IDG News Service pointed out the unusually high price. The Joule boards are like Raspberry Pi 3, with all major components crammed on a circuit board. But Joule is tricked out with recently released components, memory and storage, making it the fastest board computer in its class. The Joule boards have the latest Atom processors based on the Broxton architecture, GPUs capable of 4K video capture, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, LPDDR4 memory, USB 3.0 ports and internal storage up to 8GB. Raspberry Pi 3 has an ARM processor, no internal storage, USB 2.0, 1080p graphics processor and slower memory and Wi-Fi. Intel designed the Joule board for the development of robots, drones and smart devices requiring heavy processing power. But like Raspberry Pi 3, which is also being used as a PC, the Joule is powerful enough to be a low-end PC or server.

Twitter Facebook This Intel board computer can be a powerful Ubuntu 16.04 Linux PC Intel's Joule now supports Ubuntu 16.04 desktop OS Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 21 December, 2016 03:11 - - - - print email Comments If you want a PC with Ubuntu Linux, you can turn to Intel's Joule single-board computer instead of buying an expensive machine. Support for Ubuntu 16.04 desktop OS has been added to the Joule board, according to developer notes for Intel IoT Developer Kit 5.0 released late last week. Intel has two Joule boards: the 570x, which sells for $219 on Mouser, and the 550x, which is priced at $179 on the same retail site. The 550x, which started shipping recently, was priced at $349 until Monday, but was cut in half after a story by the IDG News Service pointed out the unusually high price. The Joule boards are like Raspberry Pi 3, with all major components crammed on a circuit board. But Joule is tricked out with recently released components, memory and storage, making it the fastest board computer in its class. The Joule boards have the latest Atom processors based on the Broxton architecture, GPUs capable of 4K video capture, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, LPDDR4 memory, USB 3.0 ports and internal storage up to 8GB. Raspberry Pi 3 has an ARM processor, no internal storage, USB 2.0, 1080p graphics processor and slower memory and Wi-Fi. Intel designed the Joule board for the development of robots, drones and smart devices requiring heavy processing power. But like Raspberry Pi 3, which is also being used as a PC, the Joule is powerful enough to be a low-end PC or server.

Intel Has More DRM Graphics Code For Testing, Targeting Linux 4.11 Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 26 December 2016 at 11:39 AM EST. Add A Comment While Linux 4.10-rc1 was only released yesterday and there will be about two months before it rolls around to the Linux 4.11 merge window, Intel OTC already has new code ready for testing. Intel i915 DRM maintainer Daniel Vetter published the latest changes for their -testing branch of material that will in turn target Linux 4.11. Changes up for testing include some DisplayPort link rate fixes, prep work for atomic watermark updates on Valleyview and Cherryview, a clean-up to the platform enumeration code, Gen9 (Skylake) watermark fixes, prep work for DisplayPort link failure fallback handling, GEM_WARN_ON support, overlay fixes, and other code changes. More details via this mailing list post. No big new features at least not yet, but lots of fixes are always welcome.

The Most Popular Vulkan News From 2016 Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 26 December 2016 at 10:09 AM EST. Add A Comment While Vulkan 1.0 only made its public debut in February, on Phoronix in 2016 were 231 news items so far about this new graphics API from The Khronos Group, not counting the dozens of benchmarking articles looking at length about GPU/driver Linux performance. The release of Vulkan 1.0 is one of my favorite highlights of 2016. Given all of our Vulkan news on Phoronix from bechmarks to driver news to specification updates to interesting Vulkan projects, here is a look at the most popular Vulkan news on Phoronix from this calendar year. Following that are our most viewed featured-length articles / reviews featuring Vulkan. The top 12 most viewed Vulkan news items from 2016: Some Early Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu Linux Vulkan Tests With NVIDIA Graphics While waiting to test Ubuntu Bash on Windows, I decided to run some (manual) tests of Vulkan on Windows compared to some recent Ubuntu Linux figures with different NVIDIA graphics cards. Intel Vulkan Linux Driver Lands Color Compression Support For Skylake It's been another busy day in Mesa Git for Intel's "ANV" Vulkan open-source Linux driver. CryENGINE Is Planning To Deliver Its Vulkan Support In About Two Months The middle of October is when Crytek should be publicly rolling out their Vulkan API support in the CryENGINE. Early Radeon Vulkan Windows vs. AMDGPU PRO Linux Benchmarks On Friday I posted Some Early Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu Linux Vulkan Tests With NVIDIA Graphics while today the tables have turned to show The Talos Principle on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 Linux under AMD Radeon graphics. AMD's Vulkan Driver Will Only Work With The AMDGPU Kernel Driver I've just received confirmation from AMD that their forthcoming Vulkan driver will only work with the AMDGPU DRM kernel driver. This means that unless this AMDGPU kernel driver is extended to support pre-VI hardware, only the very latest AMD GPUs on Linux will work with Khronos' next-generation API. Direct3D 11 vs. OpenGL vs. Vulkan Radeon Benchmarks On Windows & Linux After making the Direct3D 11 vs. Vulkan vs. OpenGL benchmarks available to Phoronix Premium subscribers this weekend, these results are now available to everyone. Enjoy. Running The Latest Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu Linux OpenGL/Vulkan Benchmarks Now that my Linux reviews of the GeForce GTX 1070 and GeForce GTX 1080 have been published, next on my agenda this week are running some fresh Windows vs. Linux graphics benchmarks with these Pascal graphics cards. You Can Help Bring Vulkan Support To Older AMD GCN GPUs Earlier today I wrote about how AMD will only be supporting Vulkan with the AMDGPU DRM kernel driver and not the more common Radeon DRM kernel driver. Here's a few more points to clarify the situation. Intel's Vulkan Linux Driver Gets ~30% Performance Boost, Now Faster Than OpenGL With our past Intel Vulkan benchmarks the Vulkan driver was slower than the mature OpenGL driver but this is about to change with an important patch-set published today: a big performance boost is in store. Valve Is Finally Releasing Dota 2 With Vulkan Support Very Soon It has taken longer than anticipated, but it looks like Valve will be releasing Dota 2 with Vulkan API renderer support within the next week. AMD Posts Initial AMDGPU Hybrid Driver With Vulkan Support Well, AMD has just sent out a pleasant surprise before the weekend: an initial AMD Hybrid Linux driver build! It's AMDGPU-based providing OpenGL and Vulkan support on the new stack! What A Developer Thinks About Vulkan After Using It In A Game Engine One of the developers behind a new open-source 3D game engine written in C++ and using Vulkan and DirectX 12 as rendering back-ends has shared his thoughts on this new Khronos graphics API after diving into it for this project. And then the featured articles with Vulkan: Vulkan 1.0 Released: What You Need To Know About This Cross-Platform, High-Performance Graphics API Today's the day! It's Vulkan day! After the better part of two years of hard work, Vulkan 1.0 is ready to meet the world! Today The Khronos Group is announcing the release of Vulkan 1.0 with an embargo that just expired. This hard-launch today is met by the public release of the first conformant driver. The first Vulkan-powered game is also in public beta as of today, but the Linux situation as of today isn't entirely exciting for end-users/gamers as most vendors are still baking their Linux support with Windows generally taking priority. However, even ignoring operating system differences, you need to make sure your expectations are realistic before trying to fire up a Vulkan game while giving developers time to learn and design for this new graphics API. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 On Linux: OpenGL, OpenCL, Vulkan Performance $699 USD is a lot to spend on a graphics card, but damn she is a beauty. Last month NVIDIA launched the GeForce GTX 1080 as the current top-end Pascal card and looked great under Windows while now finally having my hands on the card the past few days I've been putting it through its paces under Ubuntu Linux with the major open APIs of OpenGL, OpenCL, Vulkan, and VDPAU. Not only is the raw performance of the GeForce GTX 1080 on Linux fantastic, but the performance-per-Watt improvements made my jaw drop more than a few times. Here are my initial Linux results of the Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1080 Founder's Edition. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 On Linux: Testing With OpenGL, OpenCL, CUDA & Vulkan If you were amazed by the GeForce GTX 1080 performance under Linux but its ~$699 USD price-tag is too much to handle, the GeForce GTX 1070 is now shipping for $399~449 USD. NVIDIA sent over a GeForce GTX 1070 and I've been putting it through its paces under Linux with a variety of OpenGL, OpenCL, and Vulkan benchmarks along with CUDA and deep learning benchmarks. Here's the first look at the GeForce GTX 1070 performance under Ubuntu Linux. Dota 2 Vulkan vs. OpenGL Performance Redux Earlier this week I published some Dota 2 Vulkan vs. OpenGL benchmarks with AMD Radeon and NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards under Linux. Since then I received some feedback from Valve with regards to Dota 2 on the Source 2 Engine testing along with a better demo to use for benchmarking and also using the latest Dota 2 Vulkan DLC updates. So here is a fresh look at the OpenGL vs. Vulkan performance for this popular Valve game on an assortment of NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards. AMD vs. NVIDIA Vulkan & OpenGL Linux Performance With The New Drivers Thanks to AMD having released their new GPU-PRO "hybrid" Linux driver a few days ago, there is now Vulkan API support for Radeon GPU owners on Linux. This new AMD Linux driver holds much potential and the closed-source bits are now limited to user-space, among other benefits covered in dozens of Phoronix articles over recent months. With having this new driver in hand plus NVIDIA promoting their Vulkan support to the 364 Linux driver series, it's a great time for some benchmarking. Here are OpenGL and Vulkan atop Ubuntu 16.04 Linux for both AMD Radeon and NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards. Testing The Open-Source "RADV" Radeon Vulkan Driver vs. AMDGPU-PRO With word coming out last week that the RADV open-source Vulkan driver can now render Dota 2 correctly, I've been running some tests the past few days of this RADV Vulkan driver compared to AMD's official (but currently closed-source) Vulkan driver bundled with the AMDGPU-PRO Vulkan driver. Mesa 12.0 Released With OpenGL 4.3 Support, Intel Vulkan & Many Other Features While it's coming late, the huge Mesa 12.0 release is now official! Mesa 12.0 is easily one of the biggest updates to this important open-source user-space OpenGL driver stack in quite some time and will offer much better support and features especially for Intel, Radeon, and NVIDIA open-source Linux desktop users/gamers. NVIDIA vs. AMD OpenGL & Vulkan Benchmarks With Valve's Dota 2 Yesterday marked the public availability of Dota 2 with a Vulkan renderer after Valve had been showing it off for months. This is the second commercial Linux game (after The Talos Principle) to sport a Vulkan renderer and thus we were quite excited to see how this Dota 2 Vulkan DLC is performing for both NVIDIA GeForce and AMD Radeon graphics cards. Here are our initial Dota 2 benchmarks with Vulkan as well as OpenGL for reference when using the latest Linux graphics drivers on Ubuntu. Trying The New AMD GPU-PRO Linux Driver On Ubuntu With Vulkan, OpenCL & OpenGL On Friday night to much surprise, AMD published the beta version of their new hybrid Linux driver stack with Vulkan support alongside OpenCL, OpenGL, and VDPAU support. Here's some more details from my initial testing of this new driver that AMD is currently calling the Radeon Software AMD GPU-PRO Beta Driver for Linux. Radeon Vulkan Driver Added To Mesa, Fresh Radeon Vulkan vs. OpenGL Benchmarks + AMDGPU-PRO Today the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver is landing in mainline Mesa and just hit the Git code minutes ago. Merging the RADV driver came up just over the past few weeks in time for next month's Mesa stable release while this community-based driver was developed over the summer by David Airlie and Bas Nieuwenhuizen. This "unofficial" Radeon Vulkan open-source driver is now becoming part of the Mesa code-base with it being able to support the few Vulkan Linux games but isn't yet a fully conformant driver. Here are fresh benchmarks of the RADV driver compared to the RadeonSI OpenGL driver and benchmarks compared to AMD's hybrid closed-source AMDGPU-PRO driver on several different graphics cards.

Increasingly, it is becoming easier to find a lightweight notebooks that are quite capable of being the primary laptops for work. Then there are some which can double up a tablet too. And this is the sort of flexibility that most professionals are looking for, when travelling or while working remotely. Here are some of the best picks starting at as low as Rs15,000. Lenovo Ideapad is one of the bets entry level notebooks. Lenovo Ideapad 100s Rs 14,999 If your workload is limited to few mails, typing out articles, making social media posts and web browsing, the Ideapad is one of the bets entry level notebooks you can get. Despite an all-plastic exterior it doesn’t feel poorly built. The compact size, light form-factor (1kg) and sleek profile, makes it easy to carry around. The 11.6-inch display is sharp (1,366x768p) and big for most of these basic tasks. It runs Windows 10, is powered by Intel’s Atom Z3735F processor paired with 2GB RAM and offers 32GB of storage. Despite the slim profile, it still has two USB ports and memory card slots. Acer One 10 S1001 s available in the vicinity of Rs 20,000. Acer One 10 S1001 Rs 20,649 Buying a convertible isn’t a costly affair anymore. A good one like this is available in the vicinity of Rs 20,000. It comes with a 10.1-inch multi-touch display that can be detached from the keyboard and used as a big screen tablet. The whole device (with the keyboard) weighs 1.3kg while the tablet tips the scales at just 640g. The Acer One 10 is not a power house by any means, but can take care of your day to day tasks with ease. It uses the same Intel Z3735F processor that we saw in the above mentioned Lenovo notebook and runs Windows 10 out of box. What makes this unique is the 500GB hard drive space, more than what many rivals offer. Asus ZenBook Flip Rs 46,990 This is mid-range convertible which offers the look and build quality of a high end Windows laptop. The brushed aluminium exterior adds solidity and keeps the weight in check. It weighs just 1.3kg which is impressive for a 13.3-inch display notebook. It is called Flip because the display can be flipped backwards until its touches the back of the keyboard and used as a single screen tablet. This is the entry level of the Flip and runs on adequately powerful Intel’s 6th gen Core m3 processor known for its low power consumption. Its paired with 4GB RAM. The laptop offers 512GB SSD and claims a battery backup of up to 10 hours. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 offers 12.3-inch full HD (1,920x1080p) display and 128GB SSD. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Rs 73,890 The Surface Pro 4 is a perfect tablet convertible for professionals looking for something really compact and light (weighs just 786g) but powerful enough to handle some heavy tasks from time to time. Powered by Intel’s 6th gen Core i5 processor with 4GB RAM in tow, the Surface Pro 4 offers 12.3-inch full HD (1,920x1080p) display and 128GB SSD. The tablet has metal finish that gives it a premium look while the in-built kickstand allow it to be propelled backwards while you can type away on the detachable Surface type keyboard. The keyboard is sold separately and costs Rs12,490. HP Spectre 13 is an excellent option in terms of looks as well as performance. HP Spectre 13 (123TU) Rs 1,05,090 If price is no constraint and Windows 10 is a major requirement, the Spectre 13 is an excellent option in terms of looks as well as performance. Driven by Intel’s 7th gen Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD, this is one of the bets looking productivity laptops in the market. With the lid closed, it measures just 10mm and weighs about 1.1kg, making it one of the lightest and slimmest notebooks in the market right now. The 13.3-inch display offers a resolution of 1,920x1,080p, supports touch and has a layer Gorilla glass 4 to protect it against scratches.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums TR's 12 days of giveaways: Gigabyte's great gear, with Arctic bonus by Bruno Ferreira  5:04 PM on December 27, 2016 Hello and good afternoon, dear gerbils. We're most pleased to see you all in good health. You all seem a little plumper—we wonder if that's the effect of the cameras or all the Christmas food you gorged on. We're waiting on TR Santa, watching the afternoon sky for any sign of his reindeer-powered sled. Ah, we finally see it. But it appears to be flying much lower and slower than usual, and swerving around a little. It seems to be particularly loaded, and now it's landed. Uh, is that Santa? He's a bulky enough man, but apparently the steady diet of milk and cookies seems to have taken its toll. We think his sweater is bursting at the seams. He's kindly asked us to go pick up the bag as he's unable to walk (or roll?) the distance. Ah, there we are. Let's see what's in today's bag... Oh. My. Goodness. What a sweet combination. This is a bag of Gigabyte and Arctic gear, and it contains a GA-Z170X-UD5 TH mobo, a GeForce GTX 1060 G1 Gaming 3GB graphics card, and an Arctic P533 Racing headset. Let's take a closer look at the items, shall we? In today's prize pack, we have an extra-spiffy motherboard. The Gigabyte GA-Z170X-UD5 TH (going for $240, imported) is a badass mobo with everything an enthusiast could ask for, plus a couple bathroom sinks. Let's start ticking off items: an honest-to-goodness Intel Thunderbolt 3 controller, a high-end Realtek ALC1150 audio codec and enhanced audio circuitry, an Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller, and two USB 3.1 Type-C ports. Then there's not one but two PCIe M.2 connectors, a total of three SATA Express ports, reinforced PCIe x16 slots, and both SLI and CrossFire support. Enough hardware for you? Next up, there's this neat Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1060 G1 Gaming 3GB graphics card (worth $220). Not all GTX 1060s are the same, and this particular variant offers a GPU with a whopping 1847 MHz boost clock when using the card's OC Mode. If you feel like playing it safe, you can stil leave it in Gaming mode and get an 1809 MHz boost clock rate. Gigabyte's tried-and-true dual-fan setup nicely complements the card. Today's gift triptych is complete with something out of left field. The retro-styled Arctic Cooling P533 Racing headset (a $78 value) places 40-mm neodynium drivers inside over-ear, closed-back enclosures with a hefty amount of padding. The integrated boom mic is articulated in two spots for extra comfort, too. There's no volume control in the headset's cable—instead, there's an actual volume knob on one of the cans, as a homage to vintage headphones. And now for the moment you've all been waiting for. Today's prize haul definitely steps up the gifting game, and we bet that you're all dying to know if you're going to get all this hardware as a belated Chrismas gift. But first, our usual countdown: we must start from the number of eggnog shots downed during the past week. That ought to keep you busy for a while. All done? Great! Our winner today is (drumroll)... David Sipes. Congratulations, for this bag of gifts is yours. Our biz handler will be in touch with you soon. Meanwhile, Krogoth couldn't attend, as he's apparently still recovering from eggnog overdose. Word is he found the drink impressive enough, if you can believe that. Let's have a round of applause for Gigabyte. The company's been a great partner for a long time, and kicked in what's a huge haul of hardware for our giveaway. Spoiler alert: there's even more Gigabyte stuff to give away. If you'd be so kind, please follow the company's Twitter feed and hit Like on its Facebook profile. Don't forget about Arctic, though. Arctic is a long-running name in the cooling and accessory market, and jumped in this giveaway at the last minute. The more the merrier, we say. Go ahead and hit Follow on the company's Twitter account and the Like button on its Facebook page. Don't forget to sign up for the remaining random draws in TR's 12 days of giveaways. TR Santa still has goodies to deliver over the next few days, and you still have good chances. We'll have another giveaway tomorrow, but in the meantime, you can take a sneak peek at an item that may or may not be up for grabs: Tags: Graphics Motherboards Multimedia Miscellaneous Register | Remember me View options x Subscriber options: E-mail me when people reply to my comments Comment sorting order: Flat, chronologicalNo threading.

NATE RAYMOND NEW YORK — Reuters Published Tuesday, Dec. 27, 2016 5:40PM EST Last updated Tuesday, Dec. 27, 2016 5:40PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Three Chinese citizens have been criminally charged in the United States with trading on confidential corporate information obtained by hacking into networks and servers of law firms working on mergers, U.S. prosecutors said on Tuesday. Iat Hong of Macau, Bo Zheng of Changsha, in mainland China, and Chin Hung of Macau were charged in an indictment filed in Manhattan U.S. federal court with conspiracy, insider trading, wire fraud and computer intrusion. Prosecutors said the men made over $4-million (U.S.) by placing trades in at least five company stocks based on inside information from unnamed law firms, including about deals involving Intel Corp. and Pitney Bowes Inc. The men listed themselves in brokerage records as working at information-technology companies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a related civil lawsuit. Mr. Hong, 26, was arrested on Sunday in Hong Kong, while Mr. Hung, 50, and Mr. Zheng, 30, are not in custody, prosecutors said. Defence lawyers could not be immediately identified. The case is the latest U.S. insider-trading prosecution to involve hacking, and follows warnings by U.S. officials that law firms could become a prime target for hackers. “This case of cyber-meets-securities-fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: You are and will be targets of cyberhacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals,” U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in Manhattan. Prosecutors said beginning in April, 2014, the trio obtained inside information by hacking two U.S. law firms and targeting the e-mail accounts of law-firm partners working on mergers and acquisitions. Prosecutors did not identify the two law firms or five others they said the defendants targeted. But one matched the description of New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, which represented Pitney Bowes in its 2015 acquisition of Borderfree Inc., one of the mergers in question. The indictment said that by using a law firm employee’s credentials, the defendants installed malware on the firm’s servers to access e-mails from lawyers, including a partner responsible for the Pitney deal. Cravath declined to comment. In March, Cravath confirmed discovering a “limited breach” of its systems in 2015. Prosecutors also accused the defendants of trading on information stolen from a law firm representing Intel on the chip maker’s acquisition of Altera Inc. in 2015. Intel’s merger counsel on the deal was New York-based Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP. The law firm declined to comment.

So in this article, we’re going to look at some of the simple steps you can take to secure your entire online life. Use Two-Factor Everywhere (Especially With Email) Two-factor authentication What Is Two-Factor Authentication, And Why You Should Use It What Is Two-Factor Authentication, And Why You Should Use It Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security method that requires two different ways of proving your identity. It is commonly used in everyday life. For example paying with a credit card not only requires the card,... Read More is a quick and simple way of securing many of the tools that you use online. It basically uses something you know, like your password, and something you have, like your phone, to generate a code before you are able to log in. Your email address is the skeleton key to all of your online services. If an attacker gets in to your emails, it’s all over as attackers can quickly generate password reset links to get in to all of your other accounts. By enabling two-factor on your email account, you add the extra layer of security to prevent attackers from getting in. So unless they have your phone and your user account details, they’re very unlikely to get in. All of the main email providers like Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo! will allow you to use two-factor. If you’re a Gmail user, there are also some extra security measures you can take How to Secure Your Gmail Account in 3 Easy Steps How to Secure Your Gmail Account in 3 Easy Steps For many of us, getting our Gmail accounts hacked would be the end of the world.

So enabling it for as many of the services that you use as possible will bolster you security. At first it may be frustrating to get to grips with, but you soon get used to it. Encrypt Your Device Encryption will ensure that if your device goes missing, the data stored on it is safe and secure. Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS all offer free encryption options, so there really isn’t any excuse for not encrypting. For Windows and Mac, it’s BitLocker Free Military-Grade Privacy For Your Files: How Bitlocker Works [Windows] Free Military-Grade Privacy For Your Files: How Bitlocker Works [Windows] Ever heard that quote about trying to explain how a television works to an ant?

That is, they have been going through the call records of... Read More . Protect Your Lock Screen These days, many smartphones and tablets come with fingerprint recognition for unlocking your device. It’s obviously more secure than having nothing at all, but a PIN on your lock screen is better than using fingerprint recognition. “Why?” I hear you yell. It’s simple really. The fifth amendment has a safeguard in place to prevent self-incrimination. If a government body were to ask you to unlock your device, you could forget your PIN, but you can’t change your fingerprint. So with a court order, you could be forced to unlock your device. With a PIN, its not so simple. Not to mention, having a protected lock screen can stop the opportunist from getting at your phone. When setting a PIN, be sure to use something that isn’t obvious. Data Genetics did a recent survey on PIN codes, and the table above shows the 20 most common of the 7 million sampled. Most of the PIN codes in the table above follow some kind of pattern. Us humans love patterns, so if you stick to a PIN that doesn’t have an obvious pattern, then it’s less likely to be guessed. Encrypt Your Text Messages Services like Whatsapp now encrypt by default Why WhatsApp's End-to-End Encryption Is a Big Deal Why WhatsApp's End-to-End Encryption Is a Big Deal WhatsApp recently announced that they would be enabling end-to-end encryption in their service. But what does this mean for you? Here's what you need to know about WhatsApp encryption. Read More . This is great because it stops anyone from spying on your private conversations. However, it doesn’t support standard text messaging and the recipient needs to be using Whatsapp as well. There are alternatives to Whatsapp that allow for end-to-end encryption, such as Telegram Telegram Provides A Secure & Fast-Growing Alternative To WhatsApp Telegram Provides A Secure & Fast-Growing Alternative To WhatsApp Read More and Signal. All these tools also allow you to make encrypted calls, so can be a lot more secure than traditional calls or text messages. Edward Snowden himself actually recommends Signal. The vast majority of people nowadays do have Whatsapp on their phone, as it’s more secure and has more functionality than a simple text message. So even though it’s a requirement for your friends to have the app as well, it’s not really an issue any more. If you don’t have Whatsapp on your device, I urge you to start using it ASAP. It’s free, after all. Search in Private Many people know that Google is a privacy black hole Five Things Google Probably Knows About You Five Things Google Probably Knows About You Read More , yet it’s still the site that most people turn to when they have a question about pretty much anything. But there are alternative search engines out there that don’t store information about you. So you get the answers to your questions, and your privacy remains in tact. The biggest of these privacy aware search engines is DuckDuckGo 8 Search Tricks That Work on DuckDuckGo but Not on Google 8 Search Tricks That Work on DuckDuckGo but Not on Google Google Search is king. But DuckDuckGo has earned a loyal fan following. It has a few unusual features that even Google doesn't have. Read More . The DuckDuckGo privacy policy is very simple.

If one of your accounts gets compromised, then all of your accounts are effectively compromised along with it. The solution is a password manager, like LastPass Master Your Passwords For Good With Lastpass' Security Challenge Master Your Passwords For Good With Lastpass' Security Challenge We spend so much time online, with so many accounts, that remembering passwords can be really tough. Concerned about the risks? Find out how to use LastPass' Security Challenge to improve your security hygiene. Read More . A password manager will allow you to generate random passwords and will automatically log you in to sites you have stored. This means that you only need to remember to main password for your manager, and it will do all the hard word for you. Just don’t forget to enable two-factor authentication on your password manager! Use Tor (Not Incognito) Incognito mode, or private browsing if you don’t use Chrome, allows you to surf the web anonymously, and no one can see what you have been up to. It’s great, right? Wrong! If you’re using incognito mode on your machine, your internet service provider, network administrators and the makers of your browser can still see what you have been looking at online. It’s a common misconception that incognito mode is private. It isn’t, it just doesn’t save any history to the local machine. If you want a way to browse the internet more privately, take a look at Tor TOR For Newbies: When Should You Use It? TOR For Newbies: When Should You Use It? Savvy users should already know whether using TOR is right for their needs, but what about the newbies out there? Read More . On the desktop, it’s as simple as downloading and installing the Tor Browser (which is based on Firefox, so should be familiar to most).

But if you want truly private browsing, Tor is the closest that most people will get. This Is How You Stay Secure It’s important to remember that it is impossible to remain 100% secure whilst online. Attackers will always find a way in, given enough time. These tips will make a would-be attacker’s life very difficult, but that doesn’t mean you should ever let your guard down. Remember, only the paranoid survive! Do you have any other tips for staying secure online? If so, feel free to share them below.

Windows versions that include BitLocker are NOT free. Reply Kev Quirk December 28, 2016 at 10:15 am All versions of Windows 10 come with device encryption out of the box. This is bundled in with the cost of the OS. Reply PD December 28, 2016 at 6:08 am Firefox's Private Window uses Tor by default. You failed to mention that. Password managers are a very debatable option. Simplification where the user only needs to remember one password also minifies the hacker's target yet enables maximum results. Also, how do they work with 2FA? Password managers that store that one critical password on an internet-connected device (in 'the cloud') are also exposing users to masses of hacking attempts that have succeeded: https://blog.lastpass.com/2015/06/lastpass-security-notice.html/ Surely you could have mentioned more password manager services than one, the one that was hacked? Is DuckDuckGo still repurposing Bing / Yahoo results without tracking whilst adding some of it's own features? It needs to be acknowledged that whilst DDG may be less invasive of our privacy, a very admirable feature, it's results may make life harder. Also, tracking is more a privacy than a security feature, is it not? Reply Kev Quirk December 28, 2016 at 10:58 am Please can you link to some Mozilla documentation about them using Tor for private browsing as I'm not aware of this? To my knowledge, they have an anti-tracking feature which can be turned on or off, but this is far from Tor. LastPass have been hacked, but the way that they encrypt, hash and salt the data prior to being transmitted means that even if hackers get user data (which they never have, it's only ever been auth hashes), it will be pretty much impossible to crack. Respected security professionals have gone on the record to say that they have never been concerned with any of the hacks that LastPass have received. Here is an interesting article about how LastPass secures user data. It's worth being familiar with this information in order to understand how difficult it would be to get user data in clear text. https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&id=6926 These tips shouldn't be used in isolation, they should be used in conjunction. So continuing with the LastPass example, yes you have a single password that accesses everything else, but with 2FA also enabled, this is now far more secure. More so if you use something like a Yubikey. By the way, most people who don't use a password manager have approximately 3-4 password iterations that they use, and they only differ by one character in most cases. Reply PD December 28, 2016 at 1:04 pm Well colour me embarrassed and regretful. I swear I saw a release note or something about Mozilla doing the sensible thing, allbeit eons after Snowden, and making - at least - Private Browsing mode TOR by default. Gee Mozilla doesn't have a clue how to value-add and differentiate Firefox anymore. Must have been this article: http://www.ghacks.net/2016/07/04/tor-privacy-settings-coming-to-firefox/ and the Private Browsing hardening (preferences off FFS) work here: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1260929 that I was confused by. It's so bleeding hard to keep up with what Mozilla is, or more to the point is not, doing since they adopted the idiotic periodic release approach along with no less than 4 release versions! I agree there's degrees of security and nothing is ever 'secure'. and your article shouldn't be used in isolation, though it didn't exactly say so! In addition, I'd add that the word, or finite context of the word "secure" should NEVER EVER be used in any such article. You got the heading right by using "more secure" but the last h2 heading "stay secure" is dubious. Perhaps "improve your online security" ? In addition Kev, surely it's better journalistic practice to avoid generalizations? If you want to refer to "Respected security professionals", perhaps do so with ... references :) Again there's room there for nuance. Bruce Schneier recommends password managers but not the type that link wit browsers and pre-fil them as these are apparently too easy to hack. https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/09/security_of_pas.html He has written his own that relies on user's doing a simple copy/paste. It's interesting as well that your Yubikey mention only made the comments, not the article. Why is that? Perhaps you felt Yubikey is too complex for the average user? Yet my Mum uses a similar concept supplied by her bank and has done for years. In addition, whilst it is not exactly established, it appears that the next industry attempt to solve the security issue will be what arguably should have happened in year dot: people get a physical key with a digital key (certificate) on it, plug it into their computer, and that secondarily establishes their identity and authentication. They call it Universal Second Factor. http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/12/this-low-cost-device-may-be-the-worlds-best-hope-against-account-takeovers/ It's a suitably stupidly vague and convoluted name for a simple concept: give users a key ... well, who would've thought people could relate to a bloody key ... you know, those things we all carry around all day every day? Yeah yeah, some smart arses will come out and claim we should be implenting it flipping wirelessly on our 'smart' phones and over complicate the whole idea. But hopefully the standard will penetrate anyway ... if bloody laggards like Mozilla would pull their fingers out and implement it. Gawd how they've butchered their own product/market share/organiation ever since the threat of Chrome appeared. Brings tears to my eyes. Reply Zhong December 27, 2016 at 11:33 pm I would also try to use an authentication app instead of SMS to your phone. Reply Kev Quirk December 28, 2016 at 10:14 am Yes, I prefer to use an app rather than text messaging. Reply Zhong December 28, 2016 at 2:33 pm What are you thoughts on using a physical key as your login credentials? Some machines have special hardware that can use your finger prints or facial memory to login. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Asus C203CA pairs up an Intel Core m3-6Y30 with 4GB of RAM and a 12.5-inch 1080p screen. When the $499 system originally popped up on the FCC’s listings earlier this year, we first noticed the 360-degree hinge and touchscreen, and it appears to be the same system listed on Newegg’s photos (shown above). More: FCC data hints at upcoming premium Asus Chromebook 2-in-1 Most notably, the new Asus Chromebook features a pair of USB 3.1 Type-C ports, a rarity except on high-end Chromebooks like the awkwardly positioned Google Chromebook Pixel. As the Type-C standard becomes more common, it’s likely to start showing up on systems of all shapes and sizes. The sixth-generation Core M processor is actually the last of its kind, as Intel has rolled the Core M chips into the standard core lineup, with a lower power level. Still, we aren’t disappointed to see one of these chips powering the C203CA, especially with 4GB of RAM, as it should provide a snappy experience even as the tabs pile up. For storage, the model listed on Newegg sports a 64GB eMMC drive, with a MicroSD card slot for expanding the system’s capacity. The keyboard is backlit as well, a premium feature that’s becoming increasingly common on budget-friendly laptops. The listing was pulled quickly, and as with any upcoming product leak, a healthy amount of skepticism is a must. That being said, a product listing from a retailer like Newegg or Amazon typically doesn’t come until the very end of the development process, so as far as leaks go, this one isn’t too hard to believe. In fact, Chromebook news site Chrome Unboxed was even able to order one from Newegg before the listing was pulled, and at time of publication, the order hadn’t been canceled, even after checking with a Newegg customer service representative. The system was listed at $499, a reasonable price for a Chromebook with some oomph under the hood and a 1080p panel. With CES right around the corner, we have a feeling Asus won’t take long in confirming or denying the existence of such a product. Share
News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Gigabyte Brix Gaming GT takes a GTX 1080 on the road by Wayne Manion  10:07 AM on December 27, 2016 We've taken a look at Gigabyte's compact Brix gaming systems in the past. Now, the Brix Gaming GT is poised to take a VR-ready to the road or living room with its compact dimensions, an Intel sixth-generation Core i7-6700K CPU, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. The Brix Gaming GT identifies itself as a gaming PC with a cluster of RGB LEDs and a pair of flaps on top that open when the system is thermally loaded. The machine comes equipped with 32GB of DDR4 memory, a 240GB M.2 SSD, and a 2.5" 1TB hard drive. Gigabyte doesn't say whether the included SSD is of the NVMe or AHCI variety, though. The system also sports room for a second 2.5" drive. Networking is handled by an Intel 3165NGW Wireless-AC Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo adapter, along with a Gigabit Ethernet port powered by a Killer E2400 chip. For peripheral connectivity, the Brix Gaming GT offers both USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C ports, three USB 3.0 Type-A connectors, and HDMI and audio jacks on the back. Front panel connections include audio jacks and another pair of USB 3.0 Type-A ports. The power connector, Ethernet jack, and additional display connectors are all stashed on the bottom of the device, where they are hidden from view. At first glance, the Brix Gaming GT looks like it is ready to take on tiny desktops like Zotac's Zbox Magnus EN1070 we recently reviewed. The 10.9" x 15.1" x 5.0" (27.6 cm x 38.4 cm x 12.8 cm) dimensions make the Brix over five times larger than the Zotac miniature gaming box, though in the Brix's defense, there is no external power brick cluttering things up.

(TSMC) says that 10nm is on schedule, countering news media reports that the yields of TSMC and Samsung at the industry’s most advanced technology node are lagging expectations. TSMC’s 10nm process is “totally on track” and will contribute to sales revenue for the first time in the first quarter of 2017, according to Elizabeth Sun, senior director, TSMC's Corporate Communications, refuting a report by Taiwan’s Digitimes website that was picked up by other news media. The company’s 10nm process will account for less than one percent of TSMC’s overall revenue during the first quarter of 2017, she said. Intel, Samsung and TSMC have been vying to be first with 10nm SoCs and capture profits from foundry customers such as Apple and Qualcomm. In November, Qualcomm announced it is in production with its next generation mobile SoC, the Snapdragon 835, in Samsung's 10nm process. Intel, earlier this year, said that its 10nm process could outperform other foundries and will be used to make ARM-based mobile chips for companies including LG Electronics. In the third quarter this year, TSMC transferred 10nm development from R&D to production and had five tape outs lined up for mobile products. The company predicted that high-end smartphones, the main driver in the semiconductor business, will move to 10nm from 16nm during 2017. While some industry executives say that Moore’s Law has reached its limit at 10nm, the top three chipmakers – Intel, Samsung and TSMC – are using three dimensional tweaks to take geometries to an “effective” 1nm. Earlier this month, TSMC said that it is planning to build a fab that will make 3nm SoCs as early as 2022. Beyond 10nm, the roadmap to finer geometries is entering a new territory. TSMC has said it is still undecided on whether it will adopt extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography for 5nm and 3nm. In November, ASML said the first-generation EUV systems are almost ready for use in volume manufacturing. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers,” according to ASML Chief Executive Peter Wennink. TSMC said that it will ramp 7nm in 2017, followed by 5nm in 2019, to support smartphones and high-end mobile products with new features, including virtual reality and augmented reality. —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search Lanner Launches Carrier-grade HTCA-6000 Series to Expand Its NFVi-ready Product Lineup HTCA-6600 is designed in 6U, with six CPU blades and a combination of six Ethernet NI/switch blade slots. HTCA-6000A_front   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Telecom Network Appliance By Industry: * TelecomNEW TAIPEI CITY, Taiwan - Dec. 27, 2016 - PRLog -- With the advances in networking software like SDN and NFV, communication service providers and carriers benefit from the flexibility and the agility to evolve their new services. To address the needs for high availability cloud computing, Lanner introduces NEBS-compliant HTCA-6200 and HTCA-6600 HybridTCA network appliances that are NFVi-ready and certified as carrier-grade communication platform for telecommunication applications. The design concept of Lanner's HybridTCA provides modular flexibility, full component redundancy and extreme performance for today's & tomorrow's telecommunication needs. HTCA-6200 is designed with dual CPU blades and dual network I/O blades. Each of the CPU blades is empowered by two Intel® Xeon® E5-2690 v3/v4 CPUs and sixteen DDR4 R-DIMM sockets, offering extreme performance and processing power. To efficiently control and allocate load-balance, the system is built in with a BCM StrataXGS™ Trident-II BCM56854 Switch Fabric with 720Gbps. The Trident-II+ BCM 56860 with 1280Gbps fabric capacity is also an available option to provide 100GbE connectivity. The front-cabling dual network I/O blades are compatible with switch blades or Ethernet NI blades for hybrid functionality. The standard switch Ethernet blade supports four GbE LAN ports plus sixteen 10GbE ports and the optional Trident-II+ switch Ethernet blade supports two 100GbE and twenty 10GbE. Ethernet NI blade comes with thirty-two 10GbE network ports. The system comes with redundancy design for its switch blades and CPU blades, which offers backup operation in case downtime occurs to one of the blades. As a carrier-grade appliance, HTCA-6200 is NEBS compliance design and supports high-availability of redundant, swappable cooling fans and power supply units. While HTCA-6200 is built in 2U rackmount form factor, HTCA-6600 is designed in 6U, with six CPU blades and a combination of six Ethernet NI/switch blade slots. While sharing the same CPU and memory configurations as HTCA-6200, two Intel® Xeon® E5-2690 v3/v4 CPUs and sixteen DDR4 R-DIMM sockets for each blade as stated above, HTCA-6600 comes with six front-cabling, swappable Ethernet NI/switch blades. The top 2 blade slots are reserved for switch or Ethernet NI blades, while the other four slots are solely used for Ethernet NI blades. The Ethernet NI blade comes with the same configuration as HTCA-6200, which delivers thirty-two 10GbE ports. As the higher-end model, HTCA-6600 is designed with switch blade and CPU blade redundancy. In case one of the blades is encountered with failure, the other will take all the work loads. HTCA-6600 is also NEBS-compliant and supports high-availability of redundant, swappable cooling fans and power supply units. Both HTCA-6200 and HTCA-6600 are NFVi-ready and NEBS-compliant design for telecommunication applications, and have both been certified for Wind River Titanium Server NFV infrastructure (NFVI) software solution. Through the validation and pre-integration of industry-leading NFV ready hardware and software, Lanner is able to deliver carrier-grade network platforms optimized for NFV deployment, and service providers and TEMs can also be confident in selecting validated vendors in the ecosystem knowing that they are pre-validated with Titanium Server and ready for rapid service deployment.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 27, 2016December 27, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Pacific Special Acquisition Corp. Announces Signing of Merger Agreement with Borqs International Holding Corp NEW YORK and SHANGHAI, Dec. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Pacific Special Acquisition Corp. (“Pacific” or the “Company”, NASDAQ: PAACU, PAAC, PAACR and PAACW) announced today that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with Borqs International Holding Corp (“Borqs”), a leading global provider of smart connected devices and cloud service solutions for the Internet of Things (“IoT”) industry. Upon closing under the merger agreement, Borqs will become the operating entity of the combined company. Borqs, which is headquartered in Beijing, China with R&D centers in Bangalore, India and Beijing, was founded in 2007 by respected veterans in the communication technologies industry from Canada, China, India and the United States. Borqs has world renowned investors including Intel Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, SK Telecom China Fund, Keytone Ventures and GSR Ventures. Following the closing and pursuant to the merger agreement, the Borqs founders and key executives are expected to remain as key executives of the combined company and continue to drive business growth. Borqs, through its subsidiaries and variable interest entities, is principally engaged in the provision of commercial grade Android connected device software and hardware products and mobile virtual network operator (“MVNO”) services in China. Borqs had consolidated revenue of US$75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and net income of US$0.8 million and anticipates a 40% growth in revenue for 2016. Borqs’ revenues from its Android connected device software and hardware sales are primarily from international markets and revenues from its MVNO business are primarily from providing voice / data plans and mobile communication services in China. Borqs intends to introduce its IoT products and cloud solutions in 2017 to its MVNO network to generate additional recurring revenue. Yaqi Feng, Chief Operating Officer of Pacific, remarked, “On behalf of Pacific, our sponsor, Zhengqi International Holding Limited, and our sponsor’s parent, Pacific Securities Co. Ltd., we are extremely excited about the merger with Borqs. Our team looked at many opportunities in a variety of industry sectors and determined that the transaction with Borqs would provide the greatest value to our shareholders. Borqs is a leading IoT company backed by some of the world’s leading investors, all of whom will become shareholders in the new company. Borqs covers both Chinese and Indian fast growing markets, as well as developed markets such as the United States and Japan.  We are extremely excited about the opportunities ahead for this company.” Pat Chan, founder, Chairman and CEO of Borqs, also expressed his confidence in the proposed merger and of Borqs becoming a U.S. public company. “We believe that as a company with its shares listing on Nasdaq, Borqs can achieve its goals faster within the IoT industry; taking advantage of the resources from the public capital markets to bring innovations to commercially viable products and services quickly, motivate our workforce and grow together with our customers and partners to new and higher levels.” Transaction Details Under the terms of the merger agreement, Borqs will merge with and into a newly formed subsidiary of Pacific, with Borqs continuing as the surviving company. Shareholders of Borqs will receive ordinary shares of Pacific, holders of Borqs warrants will receive replacement warrants of Pacific and Borqs outstanding options will be assumed by Pacific (with the number of shares and exercise price of Borqs warrants and options being adjusted based on the merger consideration payable to Borqs shareholders).  Pacific will issue ordinary shares to Borqs shareholders in the merger at a price of US$10.40 per Pacific share based on a valuation of Borqs of US$303 million. The valuation and number of shares issued will be reduced by the net debt of the Company as of the closing and subject to adjustment based on Borqs’ net working capital as of the closing and Pacific’s transaction expenses as of the closing.  4% of the Pacific shares payable to Borqs shareholders in the merger will be held in escrow to cover any claims made pursuant to Borqs’ indemnification obligations under the merger agreement in the 18 months period following the closing. The board of directors of Pacific after the closing will be classified into 3 classes and consist of 7 directors, 2 of which will be appointed by Pacific (with at least 1 being an independent director), 3 of which will be appointed by Borqs (with at least 1 being an independent director), and 2 other independent directors mutually agreed upon by Pacific and Borqs. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including stockholder approvals of both Pacific and Borqs (although in connection with the merger agreement, Pacific received voting agreements from the requisite shareholders of Borqs necessary to approve the transactions), Pacific’s continued listing on Nasdaq Capital Markets and Pacific having at the closing (before reasonable expenses) at least $24 million of trust proceeds (together with proceeds of any private placement of Pacific stock prior to the closing). The transaction is expected to close promptly following Pacific’s special shareholders’ meeting to approve the transaction. Upon and immediately following the consummation of the transaction, assuming no Pacific shareholder redemptions and no adjustment to the  valuation of Borqs, it is anticipated that the shareholders of Borqs will collectively own approximately 78% of Pacific’s outstanding ordinary shares, and Pacific’s existing shareholders will retain an ownership interest in the remaining approximately 22%. It is expected that after the closing, Pacific will change its name to “Borqs Technologies, Inc.” EarlyBird Capital, Inc. is acting as financial advisor to Pacific. Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, King & Wood Mallesons and Ogier are acting as legal advisors to Pacific, and Fenwick & West LLP, Maples and Calder and Han Kun Law Offices are acting as legal advisors to Borqs. The description of the transaction contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the definitive agreement relating to the transaction, a copy of which will be filed by Pacific with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K. About Borqs Borqs is recognized as a global leader in smart connected devices and IoT solutions. Deloitte named Borqs as one of the fastest growing technology companies in China & Asia Pacific in 2011, 2012 & 2013. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, Borqs was awarded the Company of the Year for Innovation & Leadership in Mobile Technology for Asia Pacific from the International Alternative Investment Review. Recently Borqs received the “50 Most Promising IoT Solution Providers 2016” recognition from CIO Review magazine.

Announces Signing of Merger Agreement with Borqs International Holding Corp News provided by Pacific Special Acquisition Corp. Dec 27, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article NEW YORK and SHANGHAI, Dec. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Pacific Special Acquisition Corp. ("Pacific" or the "Company", NASDAQ: PAACU, PAAC, PAACR and PAACW) announced today that it has signed a definitive merger agreement with Borqs International Holding Corp ("Borqs"), a leading global provider of smart connected devices and cloud service solutions for the Internet of Things ("IoT") industry. Upon closing under the merger agreement, Borqs will become the operating entity of the combined company. Borqs, which is headquartered in Beijing, China with R&D centers in Bangalore, India and Beijing, was founded in 2007 by respected veterans in the communication technologies industry from Canada, China, India and the United States. Borqs has world renowned investors including Intel Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, SK Telecom China Fund, Keytone Ventures and GSR Ventures. Following the closing and pursuant to the merger agreement, the Borqs founders and key executives are expected to remain as key executives of the combined company and continue to drive business growth. Borqs, through its subsidiaries and variable interest entities, is principally engaged in the provision of commercial grade Android connected device software and hardware products and mobile virtual network operator ("MVNO") services in China. Borqs had consolidated revenue of US$75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and net income of US$0.8 million and anticipates a 40% growth in revenue for 2016. Borqs' revenues from its Android connected device software and hardware sales are primarily from international markets and revenues from its MVNO business are primarily from providing voice / data plans and mobile communication services in China. Borqs intends to introduce its IoT products and cloud solutions in 2017 to its MVNO network to generate additional recurring revenue. Yaqi Feng, Chief Operating Officer of Pacific, remarked, "On behalf of Pacific, our sponsor, Zhengqi International Holding Limited, and our sponsor's parent, Pacific Securities Co. Ltd., we are extremely excited about the merger with Borqs. Our team looked at many opportunities in a variety of industry sectors and determined that the transaction with Borqs would provide the greatest value to our shareholders. Borqs is a leading IoT company backed by some of the world's leading investors, all of whom will become shareholders in the new company. Borqs covers both Chinese and Indian fast growing markets, as well as developed markets such as the United States and Japan.  We are extremely excited about the opportunities ahead for this company." Pat Chan, founder, Chairman and CEO of Borqs, also expressed his confidence in the proposed merger and of Borqs becoming a U.S. public company. "We believe that as a company with its shares listing on Nasdaq, Borqs can achieve its goals faster within the IoT industry; taking advantage of the resources from the public capital markets to bring innovations to commercially viable products and services quickly, motivate our workforce and grow together with our customers and partners to new and higher levels." Transaction Details Under the terms of the merger agreement, Borqs will merge with and into a newly formed subsidiary of Pacific, with Borqs continuing as the surviving company. Shareholders of Borqs will receive ordinary shares of Pacific, holders of Borqs warrants will receive replacement warrants of Pacific and Borqs outstanding options will be assumed by Pacific (with the number of shares and exercise price of Borqs warrants and options being adjusted based on the merger consideration payable to Borqs shareholders).  Pacific will issue ordinary shares to Borqs shareholders in the merger at a price of US$10.40 per Pacific share based on a valuation of Borqs of US$303 million. The valuation and number of shares issued will be reduced by the net debt of the Company as of the closing and subject to adjustment based on Borqs' net working capital as of the closing and Pacific's transaction expenses as of the closing.  4% of the Pacific shares payable to Borqs shareholders in the merger will be held in escrow to cover any claims made pursuant to Borqs' indemnification obligations under the merger agreement in the 18 months period following the closing. The board of directors of Pacific after the closing will be classified into 3 classes and consist of 7 directors, 2 of which will be appointed by Pacific (with at least 1 being an independent director), 3 of which will be appointed by Borqs (with at least 1 being an independent director), and 2 other independent directors mutually agreed upon by Pacific and Borqs. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including stockholder approvals of both Pacific and Borqs (although in connection with the merger agreement, Pacific received voting agreements from the requisite shareholders of Borqs necessary to approve the transactions), Pacific's continued listing on Nasdaq Capital Markets and Pacific having at the closing (before reasonable expenses) at least $24 million of trust proceeds (together with proceeds of any private placement of Pacific stock prior to the closing). The transaction is expected to close promptly following Pacific's special shareholders' meeting to approve the transaction. Upon and immediately following the consummation of the transaction, assuming no Pacific shareholder redemptions and no adjustment to the  valuation of Borqs, it is anticipated that the shareholders of Borqs will collectively own approximately 78% of Pacific's outstanding ordinary shares, and Pacific's existing shareholders will retain an ownership interest in the remaining approximately 22%. It is expected that after the closing, Pacific will change its name to "Borqs Technologies, Inc." EarlyBird Capital, Inc. is acting as financial advisor to Pacific. Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, King & Wood Mallesons and Ogier are acting as legal advisors to Pacific, and Fenwick & West LLP, Maples and Calder and Han Kun Law Offices are acting as legal advisors to Borqs. The description of the transaction contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the definitive agreement relating to the transaction, a copy of which will be filed by Pacific with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K.

Twitter Facebook After a big 2016, next year may be A.I. tipping point Artificial intelligence progress expected to continue to accelerate in coming year Sharon Gaudin (Computerworld (US)) 27 December, 2016 22:00 - - - - print email Comments For artificial intelligence, 2016 has been a big year. After years of researchers saying artificial intelligence (A.I.) was on the cusp of a revolution, the technology has made major advances this past year. And now, finally, the beginnings of that major A.I. revolution seem to be here. "It's been a huge year in A.I.," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. "We've seen industry giants -- like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, IBM, Intel, and Nvidia -- either make A.I. their company 'north star' or add and advance the craft with new offerings to democratize A.I." In this past year, the land grab for anything A.I. was one of the most noticeable aspects of this industry. For instance, in this past year alone, at least 20 artificial intelligence companies have been acquired, according to CB Insights, a tech market analysis company. In 2016, Apple acquired Emotient, Tuplejump, and Turi, while Salesforce bought PredictionIQ and MetaMind; Google picked up Api.ai and Moodstocks; and Intel acquired Itseez, Nervana Systems and Movidius. Twitter, eBay, Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, and GE also acquired A.I. companies. Some of the companies getting scooped up were startups, meaning the big companies were often as interested in the A.I. researchers as much as the technology they were working on. That's because big players in, and out, of the tech industry see the writing on the wall. A.I. is going to be a big player, whether it's being used to help customers pick out the perfect jacket online, or give them directions around an accident on their commute home, find fraudulent action on client accounts, or interact with clients and customers using voice commands, text, and chat apps. Executives at online retailer 1-800-Flowers, for instance, say artificial intelligence technology is so important that it will completely change their business. "We are on the cusp of a change as big as when e-commerce hit," said Chris McCann, president and CEO of 1-800-Flowers.com, in an interview this fall. "It's giving us the opportunity to have such deep relationships with our customers that it'll be like the company hasn't existed before." This past May, Google showed how focused it is on A.I. during its annual Google I/O developers conference, unveiling A.I.-powered products like Google Assistant, its Google Home device, the Allo chat app and the Duo video chat app. And this past October, IBM president and CEO Ginni Rometty said during a keynote at the company's World of Watson conference that in the next five years, every major decision -- personal or business -- will be made with the help of IBM's Watson A.I. system. A statement like that takes a lot of confidence in advances coming in the technology. "We are about where I expected we'd be in the industry but, be aware, this is a moving bar and one big breakthrough could change this dynamic dramatically. And there are a lot of people in the hunt for that breakthrough," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group. "Next year, we'll see a lot more smart systems, an increasingly capable group of smart assistants and far more self-driving, and even self-flying, vehicles being tested." In other words, in the coming year artificial intelligence advances may begin to cascade, instead of simply inch forward. And A.I. itself could begin to fuel that progress. "Right now, A.I. is largely being created by humans," said Enderle. "The big wave will likely come when A.I. systems are more aggressively used to create future A.I. systems. When that happens, the speed of advancement will likely follow less of a linear scale and more of an algorithmic one." For Moorhead, he thinks 2017 will see an increasing number of companies using artificial intelligence-based platforms in their apps and services. "I also think we will start to see enterprises jumping onto the A.I. bandwagon," he added. "I expect the Tesla full autonomous car capabilities will be close to be turned on... I don't believe we're yet at the tipping point [with A.I.] but we are close. The tipping point will likely happen next year as A.I. makes its way into more apps." Dave Schubmehl, an analyst with IDC, said he too expects to see more enterprises adopting A.I. technologies in the coming year. "I think we'll see a significant increase in the distribution and use of A.I. that is embedded within enterprise applications, providing guidance, recommendations, and predictions," he said. "I think we're on track as far as what we're seeing in the marketplace." Schubmehl, however, said while there have been strong advances in conversational A.I. systems, he's disappointed there haven't been more advances in consumer-focused digital assistants. Moorhead, agreed, adding, "Intelligent agents, like Alexa and Siri, are behind where I thought they'd be." They're hoping, though, that 2017 will see that turn around.

I think the HandBrake UI is fairly good, there are just a lot of options I'm unfamiliar with, which is no fault of the devs. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Lawrence Standifer Stevens - December 27, 2016 at 7:00am The problem with open source source software — and this just MY experience — is that it is quite often built by programmers for extreme power users. Meaning, that it is lacking in the human interface niceties that most of us have come to expect in easy-to-use software. That's kind of what I've found with HandBrake. It does the job it claims to do but it is not very pleasant to use. If I had more than a couple of videos to convert, I'd most likely look elsewhere for a more polished tool.

I had no idea. I remember recommending one to a friend’s Dad, little over a decade ago. But 15 yrs…!? Go Sony! The VAIO name has brought some innovation over those years. I remember the memory stick that was advertised to work with the Playstation 2 upon that device’s release. Such was not quite the case at launch. But like the memory stick, the VAIO name stands the test of time, ever resilient. Today we have the VAIO S Series15 laptop on deck for a bit of mobile computing scrutiny. The S Series is near Ultrabook thin for a mid-sized laptop. But let’s be clear; this is no Ultrabook. We have an optical drive and a full complement of ports and full-size connectivity options, which Ultras often lack. It’s powerful, elegant, easy to use and does 1080p right out of the box on its 15.5 inch display. However, there are a few thorns on this ebony rose. But first while we’re on the subject… Design  The VAIO S Series is very thin and lightweight. In fact the design throughout has this concept in mind. There is no bulging battery pack bulk, ports are low profile and the optical drive is slot loading to avoid known hassles with trays left open. Users will want to make sure the slot is kept clean to avoid dust and lint build up around the optical drive opening. The reduced girth makes the VAIO S Series pancake-flat. We were sent the all-black version. But the unit also comes in a very sharp chrome look. Each features Spartan detailing with a large VAIO logo and smaller SONY logo on the back of the display. Open the lid and we have a handsome 15.5 inch display, low height chiclet style keys for a full backlit keyboard complete with Numpad and a couple more modest logos surrounding. The track pad is a bit larger than some and is positioned more to the left of center, which helps prevent inadvertently swiping or touching it while typing. I suppose I should call it by its official name. The VAIO S Series is the first of its kind to use the newly adopted “click pad”. It eliminates the designated left and right-click buttons. The entire “click pad” is essentially divided into 2 sections underneath the matte finish. Honestly I prefer the old style. Or maybe this particular click pad needs some optimizing. It’s touchy, feels twitchy and unresponsive at times. Hardware Under the hood we have an Intel i7-3632QM mobile CPU running at 2.20 GHz. This unit has a nice burly 12GB of system memory and is running Windows 8 Pro 64-bit with a smallish 700 GB hard drive. The display is powered by Intel’s integrated HD Graphics 4000 as well as discrete solution in the Nvidia GT 640M mobile GPU. The battery is ultra thin and lasts an adequate 4 hrs. Our model shipped with DVD optical drive but you can opt for a Blu-Ray drive if you so choose. The webcam is HD and does 720p and includes a mic for video chat and calls. Connectivity options include an Ethernet port,  2 high-speed USB 3.0 ports and a single USB 2.0 port, HDMI- and VGA-out , a single HG Duo memory stick port and a SD Card slot all for expanding your storage options. Finally we have  the 15.5-in backlit display mentioned above capable of 1080p. One of the more novel but super sweet features is USB charging. Either one of the USB 3.0 ports can charge the battery for your MP3 player, Bluetooth devices, Smartphones and just about any other device that sips juice via USB. More notably, this works uninterrupted even if the VAIO S Series laptop is powered off. That’s awesome! Software Windows 8 without a touch interface option is decidedly less awesome. I like Win 8 but I like it more when one can use it the way it was intended, over a touch screen interface to make the most of those pretty apps. The 15.5-inch display is not touch-based. So Win 8 is much easier to navigate through programs and folders with the mouse and keyboard while in the familiar desktop mode juxtaposed to the handsome tiled mode. Sony has tossed in a few of their own features to bridge the gap between Win 7 familiarity and Win 8 newness. While in desktop mode, just above the taskbar centered-left is a small tab. Click it to open VAIO Gate. This is a Start Menu-style list of SONY bloatware. You can probably guess what’s on deck. We have video editing and playback tools, ACID Music Studio, Sound Forge, DVD Architech, PowerDVD, Internet Explorer and more. Most of which will go unused and/or dumped to save space and system resources. Yet I do like SONY’s new commitment to their burgeoning Xperia line of mobile devices. The VAIO S Series can connect to your Xperia mobile device using the Xperia Link software. This is a seamless way for devices to speak and share a single internet connection when either one of your tablet or phone is without one. Handy stuff! Benchmarks The VAIO S Series model shipped to us is a solid performer, even great in many instances. This is not gamer’s box but some gaming can be  done and decently too. Tribes 2, Shank 1 and 2, Mark of Ninja and Street Fighter 4 ran at respectable playable speeds. But these are not next-gen or even current gen game titles. Looking at the numbers we see the HP Pavilion topping out with its burly gaming-friendly configuration. But more interesting is the HP Omni 27-inch All-in-One computer performance slightly besting the VAIO S Series. This was the box the wife used the play DayZ at sub 30 frames per second. Apparently the ATI Radeon HD 5570 mobile gpu can outperform an Nvidia GT 640M. Conclusion There is a lot to love and less to fuss about in the VAIO S Series. Our model is near-top of the line (sans Blu-Ray). The speed is more than noticeable and it resumes from sleep in a couple of seconds. It’s comfortable and lightweight at 4.42lbs. Windows 8 is actually fun stuff albeit less so without the touch screen interface, at which point many may just find it a waste of time and system resources. But the desktop mode is tried and true so sticking with that may be preferable. The click pad leaves a bit to be desired and felt finicky. It does support multi gesture like pinch to adjust the size of images on-screen, which is handy. Another issue– it seems to drop some wireless signals after waking from sleep or hibernation. Often WiFi connections and Bluetooth connections will not resume after waking, until a system restart. That’s just annoying, but not impossible to patch or update, I’m sure! That leaves the price, which is easily the biggest hurdle users will face when evaluating this one. At our stated configuration the damage comes to nearly $1400. For a midsized laptop that’s stepping up there a bit. There are similar performers on the market for lower cost and less flashy features like 1080p display resolutions and others the VAIO S Series handle so well. But with new slate/laptop hybrids blanketing the months to come it will be interesting to see which way the wind blows for the VAIO S Series. As it stand now it’s a great mobile computing option that will devour basic tasks like multimedia playback, internet surfing and a bit of gaming. Editor Rating: [Rating: 3.5/5] Very Good Bottom Line: The Sony VAIO S Series in this particular configuration is pretty sharp. However, this configuration may not be for everyone. For nearly $500 less you can get similar performance from a lower end unit from the same line. Pros Peppy Intel i7-3623QM CPU Gorgeous 15.5-inch display supports 1080p Great port options USB 3.0 can charge devices even with the S Series powered off Windows 8 Pro Cons Expensive in this configuration Trackpad/Click pad needs works Lost wireless connection upon wake from sleep No touchscreen leaves Window 8 a bit hamstrung The Sony VAIO S Series 15 laptop is available at Amazon in various styles and configurations.

As expected, the major update brings along a host of new presets, file types, and support for more devices to the video transcoding tool. The version 1.0.0 update also brings along bug fixes and can be downloaded for Windows, Mac, or Linux from the company site. HandBrake version 1.0.0 brings along new presets for Web as well as MKV video format while the official presets from previous version can be found under the 'Legacy' section, as pointed out by Fossbytes. The update comes with JSON-based preset system, including support for command line. The latest update adds Intel QuickSync Video H.265/HEVC encoder, which requires Intel Skylake or newer processors and brings performance improvements to the video encoder.One of the biggest changes that comes with HandBrake 1.0.0 is the inclusion of reworked online documentation that is no longer too technical, allowing laymen to figure out all the little features the transcoder offers. Audio based changes include improved subtitle rendering and updated third party libraries. "After more than 13 years of development, the HandBrake Team is delighted to present HandBrake 1.0.0. Thank you to all of our many contributors over the years for making HandBrake what it is today. We again remind everyone that the HandBrake Website is the only official source for HandBrake.

If you are interested, you can find the complete changelog of the video encoder on the company site.

Roston - Dec 27, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Cuba has announced the launch of its very first computer factory, a facility said to be able to produce up to 120,000 tablets and laptops every year. This marks the nation’s latest foray into technology, and will soon give residents a new way to get their hands on personal computing devices. Per a statement from state-run media, this facility will produce tablets and laptops featuring Intel hardware. Cuba has largely lagged behind much of the world in terms of technical development due to the U.S. embargo. Things have been changing over past months, however, and the nation is slowly catching up, including rolling out modest Internet service and even getting official access to Netflix. According to Cuban publication Granma, the Chinese company Haier will be providing this new computer factory with all of the equipment and related tech, as well as training the staff in how to use it all. There are also said to be researchers from the “University of Computer Science” working on the development of an operating system and software. This factory will reportedly produce both 8-inch and 10-inch tablets, and will also produce laptops running sixth-generation Intel processors. Further details about the operating system in development haven’t been revealed, nor a timeframe for when this factory will start production.

The three targeted at least seven major international law firms that had been retained by companies to advise on deals and successfully got into the e-mail accounts of senior lawyers at two of the firms, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday. They profited on deals and speculation involving the drug maker Intermune, chipmaker Intel and business services company Pitney Bowes, the US said. The US Securities and Exchange Commission also sued and is seeking an asset freeze. The case places law firms among the widening group of targets for cybercriminals seeking to profit from insider information. Last year, the US broke up an international ring of hackers who allegedly infiltrated the computer servers of PRNewswire Association LLC, Marketwired and Business Wire and stole market-moving press releases before they were published. According to the SEC, the group, which included Ukrainians and a Georgian, made more than $100 million from trading on the information. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world," Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara said in the statement. The three men - Iat Hong and Chin Hung, 50, of Macau, and Bo Zheng, 30, of China - worked at a robotics company that was started by Zheng, according to the government. Hong, 26, was arrested in Hong Kong on Christmas Day and is awaiting extradition. The SEC is also seeking to freeze an account registered in Hong's mother's name. In addition to the law firms, they also hacked other robotics companies, the US said. They allegedly stole schematic designs of a robot vacuum cleaner made by a US company. The three generally used the same tactics to get the information, according to the U.S. They would get the log-in credentials of an employee and place malware on a server that allowed them to access the e-mails of key people at the firms and companies, according to the indictment. In a one-day period in 2014, they took 10 gigabytes of confidential data from one law firm's server, the US said. Continued below. Related Content Cybercrime a $600 billion-a-year headache Cartoon: It's a mad, mad world Another twist in Pike River Mine row with Parliament agreeing to hear submissions They weren't always successful, the US said. During one six-month period in 2015, the three men allegedly tried on more than 100,000 occasions to break into the networks of five law firms. The law firms weren't identified in the complaints. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP and Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP were among the targeted law firms. Neither firm responded to a request for comment on the charges. They allegedly bought shares of Intermune based on the information gleaned from the hacked data. Though the deal didn't close, they still made money as shares rose on media reports that the company was seeking a tie-up, the US said. Intermune was ultimately purchased by Roche AG. Cravath advised Intermune on the deal. In another deal, the group allegedly bought shares in chipmaker Altera Corp. after Intel had retained one of the law firms to advise on an acquisition. They scored US$1.4m in profits on the trade amid media reports of the pending deal, and sold their shares before it was publicly announced, according to the indictment. Weil Gotshal was one of the law firms advising Intel on the deal. Using information gleaned from a second law firm, the trio also bought shares of Borderfree, an online commerce site that was an acquisition target of Pitney Bowes, the US said. They made a profit of US$841,000 on the trades after the deal was announced on May 18, 2015, according to the indictment. Prior to the Borderfree takeover, Hong and Chin bought so much of the company's stock that on certain days the two accounted for 25 per cent or more of the company's trading volume, according to the SEC complaint.

Prosecutors unsealed insider trading and hacking charges on Tuesday against three Chinese suspects allegedly involved in the scheme. Authorities said one of the individuals, Iat Hong a 26-year-old Macau resident, was arrested on Sunday in Hong Kong and faces extradition to the U.S. The other two defendants, Bo Zheng and Chin Hung, were hit with 13-count indictments and remain at large. All three were also charged by the SEC, the first time the agency has charged individuals for hacking into a law firm's computer network. According to the indictment, the suspects hacked inside information by infiltrating at least two unnamed law firms between April 2014 and late 2015. The hackers scoured the emails of law firm partners to discover stocks that were likely to soar because they were targeted in merger deals, including one tech company Intel would later acquire for $17 billion. The defendants then purchased shares of those companies, scoring over $4 million in illegal profits, authorities allege. Related: Drugs, prostitutes used to bribe pension fund manager Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the case should serve as a "wake-up call for law firms around the world." "You are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," Bharara said in a statement. The SEC is seeking an asset freeze to prevent Hong, Zheng and Hung from cashing in their illegal gains. The SEC named Hong's mother as a relief defendant to try to recover ill-gotten gains in her accounts linked to the insider trading. The allegations are the latest apparent evidence of an intersection between cyber crime and insider trading. Earlier this month, a former Expedia (EXPE) IT professional admitted to illegally trading on secrets he discovered by hacking his own company's senior executives. The insider trading scored him $331,000, according to prosecutors. Authorities did not identify which law firms were victimized by the Chinese hackers. Federal prosecutors described them as "prominent U.S.-based international law firms with offices in New York." The indictment cited one incident in which Hong, Zheng and Hung allegedly hacked into a law firm that was hired in January 2015 by Intel (INTC, Tech30) to help it devise a takeover of rival chip maker Altera. The trio stole nearly three gigabytes of confidential data, including secret emails that contained the proposed takeover price in the Altera deal, authorities allege. Beginning in February 2015, Hong, Zheng and Hung purchased more than 210,000 Altera shares. Altera's stock price spiked 26% after news of the confidential merger talks seeped out in the financial press. The defendants sold all of their Altera stock several weeks later for a profit of about $1.4 million, the indictment said. Related: Expedia IT guy made $300,000 by hacking own execs The SEC said the Chinese hackers were caught using "enhanced trading surveillance and analysis capabilities" developed by the agency in the past few years. Hong, Zheng and Hung also allegedly hacked to steal secrets to benefit their robot start-up. Prosecutors said between April 2014 and late 2015, the trio stole proprietary information from two unnamed robotics companies on the technology and design of consumer robotic products, including design schematics.

Prosecutors unsealed insider trading and hacking charges on Tuesday against three Chinese suspects allegedly involved in the scheme. Authorities said one of the individuals, Iat Hong a 26-year-old Macau resident, was arrested on Sunday in Hong Kong and faces extradition to the U.S. The other two defendants, Bo Zheng and Chin Hung, were hit with 13-count indictments and remain at large. All three were also charged by the SEC, the first time the agency has charged individuals for hacking into a law firm’s computer network. According to the indictment, the suspects hacked inside information by infiltrating at least two unnamed law firms between April 2014 and late 2015. The hackers scoured the emails of law firm partners to discover stocks that were likely to soar because they were targeted in merger deals, including one tech company Intel would later acquire for $17 billion. The defendants then purchased shares of those companies, scoring over $4 million in illegal profits, authorities allege. Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said the case should serve as a “wake-up call for law firms around the world.” “You are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals,” Bharara said in a statement. The SEC is seeking an asset freeze to prevent Hong, Zheng and Hung from cashing in their illegal gains. The SEC named Hong’s mother as a relief defendant to try to recover ill-gotten gains in her accounts linked to the insider trading. The allegations are the latest apparent evidence of an intersection between cyber crime and insider trading. Earlier this month, a former Expedia IT professional admitted to illegally trading on secrets he discovered by hacking his own company’s senior executives. The insider trading scored him $331,000, according to prosecutors. Authorities did not identify which law firms were victimized by the Chinese hackers. Federal prosecutors described them as “prominent U.S.-based international law firms with offices in New York.” The indictment cited one incident in which Hong, Zheng and Hung allegedly hacked into a law firm that was hired in January 2015 by Intel to help it devise a takeover of rival chip maker Altera. The trio stole nearly three gigabytes of confidential data, including secret emails that contained the proposed takeover price in the Altera deal, authorities allege. Beginning in February 2015, Hong, Zheng and Hung purchased more than 210,000 Altera shares. Altera’s stock price spiked 26% after news of the confidential merger talks seeped out in the financial press. The defendants sold all of their Altera stock several weeks later for a profit of about $1.4 million, the indictment said. The SEC said the Chinese hackers were caught using “enhanced trading surveillance and analysis capabilities” developed by the agency in the past few years. Hong, Zheng and Hung also allegedly hacked to steal secrets to benefit their robot start-up. Prosecutors said between April 2014 and late 2015, the trio stole proprietary information from two unnamed robotics companies on the technology and design of consumer robotic products, including design schematics.

And if he does, will she accept? By David Weisberg, contributor - 12/27/16 01:00 PM EST 13,043   Executive orders barring offshore drilling in most U.S. Arctic waters; an abstention at the U.N. permitting the Security Council to declare all Israeli settlement activity to be illegal and an obstacle to peace; the possibility of further action at the U.N. to formalize the administration's comprehensive vision of a two-state solution to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict — President Obama is sprinting, not jogging, to the finish line. In dashing through his last few weeks in office, will one of Obama's final acts be to pardon Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonBruce Springsteen questions whether Trump is fit to serve Seven rising Democratic stars Democrats take sides in race for DNC chair MORE for any violations of federal law she might have committed while she was secretary of State? It's an interesting and complex question. ADVERTISEMENT We should first note that the Obama administration's decision not to prosecute Clinton would not bind the Trump administration. Until relevant statutes of limitations have expired, she could still be prosecuted by the new administration. It is possible, in my opinion, for Clinton to be prosecuted for either her improper handling of classified information on her "home brew" email server or allegations of "pay to play" arrangements between the secretary of State and donors to the Clinton Foundation, which could constitute bribery. The statute of limitations for most federal crimes is five years from the commission of the offense; that would apply to the two categories relevant to Clinton. Her tenure as secretary of State ended Feb. 1, 2013, so it is possible that the statute of limitations will not run until Feb. 1, 2018, more than a year after Donald TrumpDonald TrumpHouse GOP votes to rein in independent ethics watchdog Alums of historically black college upset band marching in Trump's inaugural parade Trump on North Korea missile threat: ‘It won’t happen’ MORE takes office. What looks like one question — will the president pardon Clinton? — turns out, on analysis, to be two. The first question is: Would Clinton wish to receive a pardon? That question seems to be a proverbial no-brainer. Surely, any person who had been in federal government would be eager to receive a presidential pardon, because it eliminates even the possibility of federal prosecution. That looks like all upside and no downside. But there is a downside, and it isn't trivial. A pardon must be accepted by the person who is pardoned if it is to effectively stymie any prosecution. Furthermore, there is solid legal precedent that acceptance of a pardon is equivalent to confession of guilt. A U.S. Supreme Court case from 1915 called Burdick v. U.S. establishes that principle; it has never been overturned. If acceptance of a pardon by Clinton would amount to confession of guilt, would she nevertheless accept it? A multitude of factors would go into her decision. She, together with her attorneys, would have to decide how likely it is that the Trump administration would prosecute her, and, if it did decide to prosecute, how likely the administration would be able to prove she had committed crimes. Since being elected, Trump has been remarkably warm towards the person he used to call "Crooked Hillary." But how confident could Clinton be that the Justice Department, under a Trump administration, would not prosecute? Prosecutorial decisions are supposed to be independent of political considerations, so Trump's recent friendliness should not be controlling once the new attorney general is in office. If Clinton believes prosecutors might be able to make a strong case against her, the value to her of a pardon increases. If she is confident that any case against her would be weak or even futile, the pardon has less value. If Clinton decides that, everything considered, she would prefer to receive a pardon, she would no doubt be able to convey that message to Obama, and then the ball would be in his court. Thus, the second question is: Would Obama grant Clinton's request for a pardon? From Obama's perspective, the decision to grant or withhold a pardon is a political and a personal one. Legal considerations do not directly arise. Like all presidents at the end of their terms, he is concerned about the legacy he leaves for history. Does he want his legacy to include a pardon of the secretary of State who served under him during the entirety of his first term in office? Because acceptance of a pardon amounts to a confession of guilt, the acceptance by Clinton would, to a degree, besmirch both Clinton and also Obama. After all, Clinton was Obama's secretary of State. If she was committing illegal acts as secretary, it happened literally on his watch. On the other hand, if the new administration were to prosecute and convict Clinton of crimes committed while she was secretary, that might be an even greater embarrassment for Obama post-presidency. In addition to calculations regarding his legacy, Obama and Clinton surely have developed over many years, both as opponents and as teammates, a personal relationship. If Clinton were to ask Obama for a pardon, how would that personal relationship play into his response? I cannot say. Days after Trump won the election, the White House press secretary was asked by Jordan Fabian of The Hill whether Obama would consider pardoning Clinton. He carefully avoided a direct answer. Instead, the press secretary said that, in cases where Obama had granted pardons, "[w]e didn’t talk in advance about those decisions." He also expressed hope that the new administration would follow "a long tradition in this country of people in power not using the criminal justice system to exact political revenge." Of course, there is also a long tradition in this country that no one is above the law, no matter how high a position in government he or she might have formerly occupied. So, those are the main considerations that would go into deciding a very complex question. It's time for all of us to show our hands. I'm saying yes, he will pardon her. Can you beat that? David E.

That is illegal,” Perez, who is running for chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), told CBS Radio News in an exclusive interview Friday. “Will dedicated career people be targeted because they were doing the right work?” Earlier this month, Trump’s team asked the Energy Department for a list of employees who have been involved in climate change issues in President Obama’s administration, but the agency rejected the request.  The Trump transition team later told The Washington Post the letter was "not authorized," adding that the person behind it had been "properly counseled." Last week, the transition team requested full reports from the State Department about “gender-related staffing, programming and funding.” The Washington Post reported that an agency official is worried the probe will lead to a “witch hunt.” Perez said he doesn’t know of any similar requests made to his agency. Nearly a dozen Democratic senators have called for an investigation into the Trump transition letter to the Energy Department. They told the independent Office of Special Counsel the letter appears to “have violated long-standing federal laws designed to protect civil servants against coercion for partisan purposes.” Perez is running for DNC chairman as Democrats seek to rebuild from devastating losses in the November election. He faces a tough challenge from Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who entered the race early and has scored a number of high-profile endorsements. Other candidates include South Carolina Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison, New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Raymond Buckley and Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown. Trump has nominated Andy Puzder, CEO of a fast-food restaurant chain, to be the next secretary of Labor. Tags Donald Trump   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 27, 2016December 27, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Working with Corporates on IoT Innovation JERUSALEM, Dec. 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — As the leading provider of full-stack hardware, software, and services solutions for remote monitoring of critical infrastructure and the environment, Ayyeka was selected as one of 12 participants for the ChallengeUp! IoT Accelerator co-sponsored by Deutsche Telekom, Intel, and Cisco. Ayyeka was chosen from an applicant pool of more than 300 companies working in the Internet of Things (IoT) space across 40 countries in the EMEAR region. Ayyeka spent six months in the ChallengeUp! program working with mentors from the three corporates from different business units, functional practices, and countries in the EMEAR region. The company developed a joint use case leveraging Ayyeka’s cyber-secure Industrial IoT (IIoT) solutions with technologies from the corporates. In addition, the company engaged numerous prospects and strategic partners and began to define a roadmap for joint sales. Ayyeka now supports Deutsche Telekom’s global SIM cards to provide connectivity from its low-power, fully-autonomous Wavelet edge devices to collect any type of data from any sensor to any software platform. The company also delivers back-end integration with Cisco ServiceGrid.

Ogg December 27, 2016 11:25 am EST Print Email Tweet It is no secret that investors have had great enthusiasm since the November election. What should be considered is that investors had found many other non-election reasons to buy stocks on pullbacks throughout the entire year. Despite a recession-risk at the start of 2016, despite Brexit and continued geopolitical risks, there have been many serious winners that blew past the markets this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was still shy of the elusive 20,000 mark on Tuesday morning, but the world’s most recognized stock index was up 14% so far in 2016, as of Friday’s close of 19,933.81. Many stocks have outperformed the market exponentially and some have doubled, tripled and quadrupled. But what about stocks that rise over 1,000% in a single year? It seems almost too large to be true, but there were some stocks that rose more than tenfold in 2016. Before just taking any screen for granted, 24/7 Wall St. crossed the gains seen at FINVIZ and Yahoo! Finance with the registered performance represented by Thomson Reuters for more accurate data. Some companies were screened out due to their size and/or due to conflicting pricing data, and other stocks have enjoyed stellar performance as well this year. Also, keep in mind that there are still three trading days left before the end of 2016 is final. Here are six stocks that have risen between 500% and 1500% so far in 2016. 24/7 Wall St. also has run a full list of the best and worst investments by class in 2016, which covers exchange traded funds, mutual funds, commodities and more. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) in 2016 has regained much of its former lost ground from the past two decades. AMD is the chief rival to Intel for personal computer and server processors, but the real drive here is around graphics processors and the hope for massive growth in virtual reality, gaming, machine learning and artificial intelligence markets. AMD shares screen as being up “only” 300% year to date, but they have been measured up over 500% from the 52-week low of $17.75. The growth of AMD has been well followed in 2016, but what is amazing is that even at a multiyear high of $11.75, many analysts see AMD shares surging even higher in 2017. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE: CLF) is a mining and natural resources player and a supplier of iron ore pellets to the North American steel industry. While the Trump infrastructure hope is one driving force, the reality is that Cliffs Natural Resources had been recovering all of 2016 after years of sliding. This was a $1.60 stock at the start of 2016, and the $8.90 share price is up 460% so far this year. That price is up over 600% from the $1.20 low of 2016, and its year high is $10.90. It is hard to know if this has run too much, with a consensus analyst price target of $7.00. After all, even with a $2 billion value now, this was a $100 stock in 2011 and in 2008. Magellan Petroleum Corp. (NASDAQ: MPET) was last seen up over 1,500% so far in 2016, and it was a penny stock earlier this year. This oil and gas exploration and production company focuses on the development of liquefied natural gas projects along the United States Gulf Coast. This is actually the new amalgamation under Charif Souki, the deposed founder of Cheniere Energy, with recent funding creating even more excitement. Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (NYSEMKT: NAK) is a mineral exploration company that holds interest in mining claims on lands in southwest Alaska that are part of the Pebble Copper-Gold-Molybdenum Project. Much of the gain is about hope that Trump will allow it to proceed with its application for a copper and gold mine in Alaska that has been stalled almost three years by environmental regulators who are aiming to protect the world’s biggest sockeye salmon fishery. The market value is now $560 million, and its shares were last seen up almost 600% year to date. Shares were at $2.10, in a 52-week trading range of $0.20 to $2.13. Resolute Energy Corp. (NYSE: REN) may have been as low as $2.25 earlier in 2016, but its price of $40.80 has shares up over 800% so far this year. With a $710 million market cap, the main excitement here is that the company is counted among the Permian Basin oil winners in Texas. If this move sounds too good to be true, Resolute Energy was briefly a $90 stock in 2011. Its 52-week range is $2.25 to $42.34, and it has a consensus price target of $47.14. Wins Finance Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: WINS) was last seen up some 1,400% so far in 2016. Its shares were indicated lower on Tuesday after having been featured by Barron’s as a little financial firm with a $3.8 billion market value but that earned just $12 million from charging fees to guarantee small business borrowings in China. Barron’s even called its stock valuation “a puzzle” and pointed to odd-lot volume and other tiny trading days still driving the stock. It was even noted that the company was baffled about the rise in its shares. At $168.79, Wins Finance has a 52-week range of $7.36 to $205.00.

A team of NIA operatives have been assigned to  President elect Adama Barrow, and his Transition Team have been under the radar of the brutal National Intelligence Agency for surveillance, the Freedom Newspaper can reveal. A team of NIA operatives have been assigned to monitor the movements and activities of President elect Adama Barrow. It’s a covert operation approved by the outgoing dictator Yahya Jammeh.

Kebba Jasseh, another senior member of the Agency, is also heading another four men unit. One of the surveillance team has been stationed outside Barrow’s residence. Their job is to infiltrate and monitor Barrow’s daily activities and movements. The other unit, has been tasked with monitoring Barrow’s motorcade. Both  surveillance team have been allocated double cabin pickup trucks by Jammeh. We are compiling the names of the other NIA agents working with Ebrima Badjie, and Kebba Jasseh. We will publish their names in due course. Meanwhile, the Inspector General of police, has issued a statement asking people interested in using convoys to apply for police permit. The goal is to prevent President elect Barrow and his team from driving around town. In annother development, Staff Sergeant Samba Jawo, and Staff Sergeant Jahateh are still detained at the NIA gutter cell Bambandingka. The men were arrested recently. Bakary Fatty, a GRTS, agricultural reporter is also detained at Bambadinka. Mr. Fatty, was given D50,000 and a double cabin truck by Jammeh prior to his arrest. Businessman Abdou Njie, who was detained since October, is languishing at Bambadinka together with former Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Sarjo Jallow. Momodou Sabally, the former GRTS MD, has been moved to the mile two prison. Omar Malleh Jabang, the guy, who used to be in charge of Jammeh’s sand mining in Kartong, is also detained.  Mr. Jabang, recently got arrested after dictator Jammeh received information that he was campaigning for the former Independent Candidate Isatou Touray. Mr. Jabang, has been held at the seized home of Fatou Nickle Touray, in Brusubi .Written By Pa Nderry MBai Source : Freedomnewspaper Sulayman Ceesay Many thanks Essa, Pa Nderry, Baba Galleh, Bamba Mass, Fatu, Fatou Jaw and other heroes of Gambian online newspapers. You guys are true heroes and when all is done and the dust settles, I hope we Gambians, with the leadership of the new administration, can find the moment to specially honour you all and pay our tributes. At this crucial time of the Gambian people’s struggle to enforce their spoken voices through the polls, we need more security around our chosen President-elect Barrow. In that context, it will help immensely if the photos of these NIA hoodlums can be obtained and posted on your online papers for all Gambians to know and make them out facially. With our eyes on them, we will be better able to add to Barrow’s security. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

But the firm CLO Touche calabrese & Associates now guys up till now we've been talking a lot about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton I wanna focus in on. The local races that we saw in November. Specifically how significant do each of you think. The DA race won by John Flynn was. How significant do each of you think the Chris Jacobs race defeating amber small NAS senate district that was so democratic. We'll start with I guess you Bruce who were taking out there and I. Do well I think. The amber small reef is interest staying I know there is she had a lot of union support. But obviously you know. She didn't win that one so. That that's gonna go a long way shaping what's going on in Albany in a district that Intel mark and it Pinto absolutely was strongly democratic and still isn't registrations no doubt about that. And of course you know reach for VA. I I think that that SUS talk about local politics being very important that that's something that shakes everybody's like I think a lot of people overlooked local politics in general and yet. If you think about it that that's really worth the rubber meets the road. The the Jacobs race in that sense it was immensely important statewide because the Republicans were again expected to lose their majority. In the senate because it was a presidential year you get a my major. Uptick in democratic voters every four years and so everybody kind of wrote them off in terms of keeping the majority what they did keep that in and even though maybe with the help of the independent Democratic Caucus they're gonna keep it and Chris Jacobs was a huge cog in in that plan that he had lost that seat. That they would have thrown everything out the window so that has tremendous ramifications going for for the next two years in terms of policy in the states that unbelievable. What happened the last time Democrats controlled. All three branches of state government what happened upstate new York and our interest that we we just got thrown under the bus literally so there's a lot at stake here. In the end an eight and a lot of state for the governor no with debt with this sort of that shift the powers are actually so the future's going to be hearing should you see. And in to keep the nine in New York State politics. You know guys all of these new politician running for problems promise term limits you know mineral for two terms and give somebody else's chance. But you know the way things toward an Albany you know the new guy or new gal gets to Albany weather issues in the assembly where he is in the state senate. You know the majority leader post some of the little desk in the corner gives them about secure office. Mean what are they gonna accomplish what this senator mark kind of proto accomplished in the short term he's been a senator. How long do you think it's gonna take Chris Jacobs to establish himself before so what does this say you know you promised us term limits. John I think we're essentially about the dynamics of the state legislature is that Western New York has an advantage that most of the regions don't hip. We have a delegation that. Many many times. Deals with the issues and a bipartisan basis. Are the senators for example meat on a regular basis Republicans and Democrats to identify. Key regional issues that they're going to advance with the leadership will what do I think with the only region the state that has that type of delegation organization. And that gets things done because now. That is the majority leader in the senate. Is not just listening to one or two isolated members but an entire delegation from the entire region it has been a very very successful. Model going back to win our three even dale Volker. A lead their respective assembly and senate delegation so. You have these meetings occurring locally in Albany every month between assembly members and senate members from Western New York identifying key projects and advancing those it has been a very successful model and I see it continuing. I wanna move into 27 team for just a moment if we're talking local politics we have to look at the buffalo mayor's race. Where it's believed buffalo mayor brown or brown will certainly run again what do you see happening there. I think it's a no brainer I I think that he's popular guy he's he's been around forever he's been in politics at different levels. I don't know who. Who will challenge in my things that we're talking about just to demographics alone Karl that is going to be relatively tough to unseat him mr. mayor decides to run. Reflect you guys under the microscope are known to run against LeBron as a controlled march ruler yeah. Yemen and in market's been mentioned many times. It it would be a very tough Ron in the city of buffalo for anybody. To take and mayor brown not only because of of his position you know politically demographically. But. Byron brown does have a very good political organization always hit us. And that comes to the forefront you know with when you window of the power and outsiders really get you know on to the unsure Erie county races we of the entire legislature. We have the controller of incumbents to fund highland possibly face a challenge. And we have incumbent sheriff Tim Howard running for reelection possibly face in his house what do you see there. Other clerk's race you've got all I've got federal hate. Election of Chris Jacobs and already there's some. Interest maneuvering that their right around four a possible run there are so I think that's gonna be the the most interest and I says it's open it's auto. Currencies so overseas right I agree sheriff Tim Howard. On I think he's. He's probably a lot because he Caroline I think so they'll. Tim Howard there is I think one of the riser if you run his record I I think he and Brady's opinion needed but I think a lot of people like this. I think he's been very good share but I think he he runs very well let's see if he's right easy guy to underestimate but. How the votes come he always is he's always got up and that you know you gotta you gotta factor that in and I know you're you're actually right he has a very high. Like ability no question. You know percentage I mean who can argue with something like this right and you also have a lot of local races up this year about half the town supervisors and Tom boards will be up. And embers being that you did the marquee. Premier race I think in terms of local government because you've got an open seat for town's supervisor and with the largest town in your account you'll most important in terms of economic development and quickly quickly here recount can. Throwers upon my. Once again name recognition I think he's done a relatively good job. He's on he's on the station a lot. On one of his ideas are. He's well spoken I think he's certainly recognition of the household name before he got to the ball enterprise that is climbing through the need to absolutely I'm on July figure would be tough to unseat him. Very good thanks for the time guys that's professor Bruce risky SUNY buffalo state and Republican strategist Karl calabrese. advertise with us Poll How confident are you that Doug Whaley is the right GM to lead the Buffalo Bills back to the playoffs?   Very confident   Somewhat confident   Not confident   View Results Top Stories Audio Get it Now 03/23/11 10:06 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 30 mins ago WBEN iPhone App 03/23/11 10:06 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 30 mins ago Perks 03/23/11 10:06 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 30 mins ago Contests 03/23/11 10:05 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 31 mins ago Photo Galleries 03/23/11 10:07 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 29 mins ago RSS Center 03/23/11 10:07 AM Posted 2112 days 12 hrs 29 mins ago Contact Us   |   Advertise With Us   |   Jobs   |   EEO Public File   |   Privacy Policy   |   Terms & Conditions   |   Contest Rules   |   Internships   |   Copyright Notice
Kantipur The Kathmandu Post saptahik Nepal Nari Radio Kantipur Kantipur TV 0Shares Share on facebookShare on twitter Money 2016: A Technological Lookback Technopolis - Prajesh SJB Rana Dec 27, 2016- With 2017 right around the corner, we can’t help but tip our hats to many of the advancements in technology that occurred in 2016. In fact, 2016 was a year for innovative technology that will drive the technology we expect to see in 2017. We’ve seen smart assistants for home, we’ve seen the internet of things take hold and we’ve also seen self-driving cars drive around actual roads without any driver input at all. We have seen 360 degree videos take root and we’ve even seen VR technology adopted to such an extent that even Nepali developers are tinkering around with the technology. But all innovations aren’t progressive and we’ve seen regressive technology as well, much like the removal of the industry standard 3.5mm headphone jacks on the iPhone which is bound to spill over newer technology as well; we’ve also seen the wide-spread adoption of an upcoming technology like the USB-C standard that might be better but the overall tech industry is still young for.  So just how important has 2016 been grand scale of innovation in technology? Innovation in technology never stops, partly because consumers keep demanding for more and partly because we haven’t seen just how far we can push technology. And 2016 has been no exception, we’ve seen tremendous advancements in the field of technology and as we slowly close of the curtains on the year that was 2016, we take a final look at just how much 2016 managed to develop and advance in the specific field of consumer electronics and technology. Here are a few devices that pushed 2016 in a new frontier of technological innovation. Nvidia GeForce Pascal Series The reason why the Pascal architecture by Nvidia has made this list is solely because of how efficient the graphic card really is. Moore’s Law, a law stating that the number of transistors inside a silicon wafer will increase every two years, has slowed down in recent years, now it’s all about architecture and efficient power and information management. The efficiency of the Pascal graphics cards are phenomenal with a 10 time performance boost in comparison with their earlier 2015 Maxwell architecture. Nvidia has also managed to scale down the cards for notebooks and laptops with minimal loss of power because of the 16nm fab size and efficient power consumption, features beneficial for all laptops. Nvidia’s Pascal architecture is a great example of efficient hardware architecture and how efficient constructions of processors can significantly boost raw performance. Efficiency is not only prioritized by graphics card manufacturers but processor manufacturers like Intel are also working with efficiency as seen with the release of newer generations on their Core line of processors. Google Home While a home assistant device like the Google Home is not an original idea since Amazon had already released the Amazon Echo back in 2014. Released two years later in 2016, Google Home builds on the original idea of the Echo and makes it better. With the powerful Google ecosystem to back-up the Home, Google Home does a much better job of understanding what you’re telling it to do than the Echo. It even looks better than the Echo with fat bottom and more slim cylindrical top that feels at home in the middle of your home. The introduction of Google Home adds to the idea of a smart-home where can you control all of your technological devices with a simple voice command that the home understands and automates the action. For example, you can tell it to play the latest season of Game of Thrones and the device automatically connects to your TV with the help of Chromecast and streams the series on your TV.  Wireless Technology All technology pioneers in the industry have hinted at a wireless future where interacting with your devices can be done without the need for a physical cable. This has happened to some extent with the popularization of wireless charging, wireless headphones and wireless storage devices. But with the announcement of a new standard in Bluetooth technology, Bluetooth 5, there are major advancements in the technology. Even though we’ve tried to move to a completely wireless environment, the Bluetooth technology has been holding us back. The technology is not perfect and we’ve had many instances where pairing two Bluetooth devices with each other has been a chore. This has been rectified by Apple to some extent with the inclusion of the W1 chip of their Bluetooth devices that makes up for many of the technology’s failures but Apple being Apple, it limited only to Apple devices. This is why Bluetooth 5 is so important to realize a truly wireless future because being the proprietary technology, it should turn into a standard that all manufacturers can take advantage of.  VR and Augmented Reality 2016 has been all about virtual reality and augmented reality. We saw the first game to utilise augmented technology, Pokémon Go, which went viral after a few days after their official release. One of the first games to fully utilise augmented reality, the game had people moving around their neighbourhoods looking for imaginary friends and people to battle their friends with. We also saw a wide adoption of VR in smartphones because of the Search giant’s inclusion of a Cardboard option on their Android devices. Many smartphones manufacturers quickly jumped on the technology by releasing their own VR headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR headsets and HTC’s Vibe Headsets. Gaming focused VR headset manufacturer Oculus also released their first consumer version of their Rift VR headset on the first quarter of 2016. But although the Oculus Rift hasn’t seen widespread adoption, the tech is being used by many tech minded people. One example of the use of Oculus in mainstream media would be the inclusion of the technology in the popular React videos produced by the Fine Brothers Entertainment on YouTube. Microsoft’s HoloLens, the augmented reality headset has also seen a pre-production release on 2016.  Drones Drone footage has also been widespread appeal on the internet and with the prices of camera drones falling, drones have turned into a device that many can afford for high-altitude footages. We’ve seen drone footage used in amateur  videos as well as large production units. And with the availability of consumer drones like the DJI Phantom 4 and Parrot Bebop Drone 2, on-the-air photography and videography have started taking root. And with great advancements in image stabilization technology, Drone footage in 2016 looks clean, stable, and awe-inspiring. While there have been countless advancements in the technology spectrum in 2016, these are just some of the advancements that have reached consumers. While the circuitry inside all of your devices have also been improved from devices in 2015, these are more subtle improvements that consumers won’t notice. But, taking a gander at some of these new and refined technologies will paint a clear picture of what technology looked like in 2016 and hopefully predict the technology that the new year of 2017 will bring us. So, here is to everyone we’ve come to love in 2016 and here’s to experiencing the amazing technology that 2017 will bring us.  Published: 27-12-2016 09:46 The Kathmandu Post ›Money › Prajesh Sjb Rana Tags: technology Next Story Bhupi Poetry Award to Ratna Shamsher Thapa › More From Money Taxi receipt system formally launched Jan 02, 2017 Stakeholders urge swift passage of Cooperative Bill Jan 02, 2017 NTB to launch tourism campaign in Europe Jan 02, 2017 Five FIs merge, start joint ops Jan 02, 2017 Morang overtakes Jhapa in terms of largest paddy producing area Jan 02, 2017 MPs spending funds for unproductive purpose Jan 02, 2017 Dishonest traders may be fined up to Rs100k on the spot Jan 02, 2017 Nepal headed for largest paddy harvest in history Jan 01, 2017 Nepse ends 2016 on a high note Jan 01, 2017 2016: A year when signs of recovery emerged Jan 01, 2017 Trending User's Feedback Click here for your comments Comment via Facebook Don't have facebook account?

That is because Amazon Web Services, his big-business computing division, is starting to affect more than just the world of computer servers, data storage and networking at the core of computing. File photo by Ted S. Warren The Associated Press i The New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Jeff Bezos of Amazon, along with a couple of his rivals, may eventually control much of the $1 trillion global market for business computers and software. That is because Amazon Web Services, his big-business computing division, is starting to affect more than just the world of computer servers, data storage and networking at the core of computing. Increasingly, it is also entangled with mobile phones, sensors and all sorts of other devices in the so-called Internet of Things. It’s the same story at Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, the other two big cloud companies. Startups and giant corporations rent the core resources, along with related software, instead of owning and running their own machines. What’s next? As innovations like artificial intelligence and connected devices become popular, customers are putting cloud components in mobile computing, home games and email marketing campaigns. In other words, the big clouds aim to be everywhere. “When has Amazon ever thought about anything other than world domination?” said Lydia Leong, who follows cloud computing at Gartner. Not content to be in big centralized data centers, she said, “they want to be at the edges, whether that is a customer’s own computers or the Internet of Things.” This aim for domination was clear at Amazon’s big customer conference, called Re:Invent, which was held in Las Vegas this month. About 32,000 people went to the fourth annual event. In one talk at the conference, an Amazon Web Services executive showed off the company’s 8,700-mile undersea cable, part of an Amazon Web global network that each day adds computing power equal to that inside a Fortune 500 corporation, and spoke about this expansion. He talked about crushing the costs of servers and networking, most likely sad news for old tech giants that make those things, like Dell and Cisco. In a nice bit of showmanship during the main keynote, Andy Jassy, the head of Amazon Web, appeared onstage with an 18-wheel truck carrying a device that could suck 100 petabytes of data out of a customer’s computers and put it in the Amazon cloud. That is equal to 2 billion filing cabinets of paper, which a surprising number of companies now possess in digital form, thanks to things like video and sensors. Put that together with some software Jassy talked about that would be on chips made by Intel but capable of gaining access to the Amazon Web cloud, and you get the picture: There isn’t a part of computing Amazon doesn’t want to touch. It is easy to see why this matters to Amazon. In the third quarter, Amazon Web had revenue of $13 billion a year, growing at 55 percent annually. Amazon Web was 10 percent of Amazon’s revenue, but more than 100 percent of the company’s operating income. Amazon’s international retail business lost money, and U.S. retail sales are nowhere near as profitable. Amazon says it is hardly moving away from a core business of providing large-scale computing, but rather finding more ways to sell stuff related to it by moving to edge devices. “We see it less as a move from one to the other, and more of an extension,” an Amazon spokeswoman, Mary Camarata, wrote in an email Saturday. “We have an enormous number of customers excited about leveraging the capabilities.” But Amazon is not alone in this business, and the competition is getting more intense. Amazon Web now has 81 services, including ways to work on home video games. Microsoft’s 67 services include Internet of Things “hubs” and email marketing campaigns. Google has 53, including ways to deploy mobile software globally and steer performance with data analysis. Comparisons of services are difficult, as one company’s service may encompass two or three offered by another. Machine learning — a method for computers to gain knowledge without being programmed with that information — is front and center for Alphabet’s Google, said Urs Hoelzle, the head of technical infrastructure at Google Compute. Google has recently shown off its own global network of submarine cables, along with local devices like cloud-connected office whiteboards. Over the next year, Hoelzle said, Google will open about one new Compute facility a month. Building out across the globe, with sometimes $1 billion or more in a facility, is critical in some cases to meet local data regulations. Equally, the big cloud companies all want to be as close to customers and their devices as possible. “Global proximity is a huge advantage,” said Corey Sanders, the director of program management at Azure. “This is a way to transform your business, including the way devices on the edge act.” There are profound consequences from the scale and ambition of this trend. Given their size, wealth and technical expertise, the big cloud companies are likely to build cheaper designs and demand lower prices for everything in computing. Who is to say they don’t affect the devices themselves? That is starting to dawn on the rest of the industry. On the first day of Re:Invent, Jassy had a private lunch with about 10 venture capitalists.

December 26, 2016 December 26, 2016 President elect Adama Barrow, and his Transition Team have been under the radar of the brutal National Intelligence Agency for surveillance, the Freedom Newspaper can reveal. A team of NIA operatives have been assigned to monitor the movements and activities of President elect Adama Barrow. It’s a covert operation approved by the outgoing dictator Yahya Jammeh. Mr. Barrow, and his team should be aware of their surroundings now towards inauguration day. The NIA surveillance team attached to President elect Barrow, have been divided into two units:  Ebrima Badjie, a senior Intel officer, is commanding the four men unit of surveillance officers. Kebba Jasseh, another senior member of the Agency, is also heading another four men unit. One of the surveillance team has been stationed outside Barrow’s residence. Their job is to infiltrate and monitor Barrow’s daily activities and movements. The other unit, has been tasked with monitoring Barrow’s motorcade. Both  surveillance team have been allocated double cabin pickup trucks by Jammeh. We are compiling the names of the other NIA agents working with Ebrima Badjie, and Kebba Jasseh. We will publish their names in due course. Meanwhile, the Inspector General of police, has issued a statement asking people interested in using convoys to apply for police permit. The goal is to prevent President elect Barrow and his team from driving around town. In annother development, Staff Sergeant Samba Jawo, and Staff Sergeant Jahateh are still detained at the NIA gutter cell Bambandingka. The men were arrested recently.  Bakary Fatty, a GRTS, agricultural reporter is also detained at Bambadinka. Mr. Fatty, was given D50,000 and a double cabin truck by Jammeh prior to his arrest. Businessman Abdou Njie, who was detained since October, is languishing at Bambadinka together with former Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Sarjo Jallow. Momodou Sabally, the former GRTS MD, has been moved to the mile two prison.  Omar Malleh Jabang, the guy, who used to be in charge of Jammeh’s sand mining in Kartong, is also detained.  Mr. Jabang, recently got arrested after dictator Jammeh received information that he was campaigning for the former Independent Candidate Isatou Touray. Mr. Jabang, has been held at the seized home of Fatou Nickle Touray, in Brusubi.

Twitter Facebook Samsung upgrades Notebook 9 laptops with Kaby Lake chips Samsung's Notebook 9 laptops are faster, but the battery life of just seven hours disappoints Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 20 December, 2016 07:52 - - - - print email Comments Samsung has upgraded laptops in its Notebook 9 series with Intel's latest Kaby Lake chips, jumping ahead of rivals expected to announce new PCs at CES. The Notebook 9 laptops, which have 13.3- and 15-inch screens, are lightweight laptops with full HD displays. Samsung didn't share specifics of chips in the laptops, which will be unveiled by Intel at January's CES. Nonetheless, there are some things you can expect. The new laptops will be faster than older models and also have better graphics. PC makers are measuring a performance improvement of about 5 percent to 15 percent improvement in Kaby Lake performance compared to the predecessor Skylake. Integrated graphics will be able to handle video beyond 1080p resolution. The battery life provided by Notebook 9 models is about 7 hours, which isn't as high as others in its class. The laptops have up to 256GB of storage, 720p webcams and 802.11ac wireless. The 13.3-inch model can have up to 16GB of memory, while the 15-inch model has 8GB of memory soldered on the board. The 13.3-inch Notebook 9 weighs 816 grams, while the 15-inch model weighs 984 grams. That's even lighter than the Dell XPS 13, which weighs about 1.2 kilograms. The port options include two USB 3.0, one USB-C, HDMI and MicroSD. The 15-inch model also has one USB 2.0 port. The laptop pricing wasn't immediately available.

Imagination will release the Series8XT family of GPUs, which could provide the underlying technology for graphics in the iPhone 8. It will succeed the Series7XT family of GPUs, which is the base architecture for the PowerVR GT7600 in the iPhone 7. Analyst firm Linley Group said the iPhone 7 GPU is the fastest among all mobile processors when operating at peak speed. The Series8XT will be even faster, and perhaps more power efficient. The iPhone 7 GPU can overheat quickly if it runs at peak speed for a long time. Imagination didn't provide further details on the 8XT or a specific release date, and did not say if the GPU would be in the iPhone 8. But Apple has used PowerVR in every iPhone to date, and recently started tuning the architecture to work better with its mobile devices. Imagination designs GPUs and licenses it to companies like Apple and Intel. Apple is also a minority shareholder in Imagination. Apple has been notoriously quiet about the underlying technology in its A-series chips. Linley Group only recently unveiled that the iPhone 7 GPU was based on PowerVR GT7600 architecture. The 8XT could be introduced in late February at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where Imagination is showing off its PowerVR GPU. The company has used GDC to launch new GPU architectures in the past. The high-end 8XT architecture is a "technology generator" and will host many new GPU features developed by Imagination, said Graham Deacon, senior director of business operations for PowerVR at Imagination. Imagination will focus on putting more performance in 8XT, Deacon said. Beyond smartphones, the company's GPUs also are used in set-top boxes, TVs and other devices requiring graphics power or focusing on visual computing. Imagination this year released the 8XE GPU, which was focused on the fast-growing low-end and mid-range phones market. The Series8XT will offer more performance. Imagination's PowerVR was once competitive in smartphones, but has lost share as competition grows. ARM's Mali GPUs based on the Bitfrost architecture are catching on strong, and Qualcomm, which is the mobile chip leader, has its own Adreno GPU.  Nvidia has the best mobile GPU, but it is being targeted at automotive and machine learning applications. There are other areas of growth for Imagination GPUs outside of smartphones, especially in automotive and set-top boxes, Deacon said. Imagination is developing many more technologies to boost graphics, and supporting vectors like image analysis add value to PowerVR GPUs. There are also opportunities in machine learning, and PowerVR could play a big role in enabling self-driving cars. Imagination is developing algorithms, and has been demonstrating neural networks running on GPU computing. Imagination is also mixing up its MIPS CPU architecture with PowerVR for drones and robots, which heavily rely on visual computing and image analysis.

ARM servers are devalued partly because many applications don't work with the chips. But ARM has acquired Allinea Software with the hope of partially resolving the compatibility issue. Allinea provides software development, debugging, and porting tools, which should make it easier for people to write applications for ARM-based servers and supercomputers. The acquisition will "provide a channel to thousands of developers using supercomputers and give us better first-hand knowledge of the issues being addressed as software is ported to new ARM-based systems," Javier Orensanz, general manager of the development solutions group at ARM, said in a blog entry. The development tools will also be used for ARM chips in deep-learning systems, which require large-scale server deployments for analytics. ARM's competition will come from deep-learning and HPC software tools offered by Intel, Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, and more recently, AMD. ARM designs chips and licenses them to third-party chipmakers like Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Intel. The company is aggressively chasing markets like supercomputing and IoT and is in the process of being acquired by Softbank for US$32.4 billion. Fujitsu is making the first ARM-based supercomputer called Post-K, scheduled to be deployed in Japan by 2020. The supercomputer will have 64-bit chips based on a new microarchitecture called ARMv8-A Scalable Vector Extension, which has vector processing abilities for complex calculations. With the Allinea deal, ARM realized its software weakness and is acting on it. It is acquiring customers and a shortcut to get more developers to write applications for ARM processors. Allinea tools are used by many organizations with some of the fastest computers in the world using other chip architectures. Allinea's team will become a part of the ARM's HPC development solutions team. ARM's acquisition won't affect Allinea's product roadmap. ARM did not reveal how much it paid for Allinea Software.

Such is the case with the new Samsung Notebook 9 refresh, which comprises up of a total of two system upgrades. First off, they do not come with Intel’s Skylake processor, but a Kaby Lake one. They will be available to purchase later and have been divided into a total of two models; a 13.3-inch one and a 15-inch one. Both of these notebooks possess a resolution of 1080p which is actually a good decision because Samsung has also managed to add a fair bit of battery life while reducing their thickness as well. According to the company, the new Notebook 9 lineup are able to deliver up to 7 hours of battery and use the USB-C interface to charge that battery. Samsung has also fitted in a new Adaptive Fast Charging tech and this is how it works. If you plug in any notebook model, be it the 13.3-inch one or the 15-inch one for a total of 20 minutes, the notebook will be able to provide you with a total of 2 hours of battery life, which is a handy feature to have. The 7 hour-battery life is said to be fully charged after a period of 80 minutes, but this will also depend on the kind of tasks you are running on the notebook. If you will be running YouTube and streaming videos at 1080p, then don’t expect battery life to last that long. Pricing details of the Notebook 9 refresh have not been stated by Samsung, but we’re looking at the CES 2017 show where they will be probably be shown, along with their pricing and availability details too. Don’t expect these notebooks to come cheap though.

Dell accidentally revealed the specifications of the XPS 15, calling it the XPS 9650. The model name was not as important as the hardware present in the notebook, and we’re glad to see that an attractive Windows 10 notebook will be arriving soon. To start off, the specs reveal that the XPS 15 is going to sport a dedicated graphics chip belonging to NVIDIA, but we’ll get to that later. What we do know is that the notebook will come armed with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and will be available to purchase in three processor models: i3-7100HQ i5-7300HQ i7-7700HQ As the name implies, XPS 15 means that the notebook is going to feature a 15-inch screen with a narrow amount of bezels, making it one of the most attractive lineup of Windows 10-powered notebooks to ever go on sale. We’re actually hoping that there’s a Thunderbolt 3 input provided, then it would mean you can attach a GPU enclosure and start immersing in gaming titles at higher resolutions and graphic settings. The 15-inch screen is said to feature a 4K resolution, but we’re sure that a 1080p resolution version should also be available. What we were surprised to hear was the GTX 1050 GPU. As you know, NVIDIA hasn’t announced its GTX 1050 or GTX 1050Ti for notebooks, meaning that the company had something special planned for 2017. Unfortunately, now that Dell’s reckless actions have revealed details on its specifications, we are confident that the announcement is going to take place hopefully during the CES 2017 trade show. Just in case you were wondering about the details the company revealed, VideoCardz managed to grab a hold of those details before the company removed them permanently. “Super-speed: The most powerful XPS laptop we’ve ever built includes the latest 7th Gen Intel® Quad Core™ processors and an optional 4GB GeForce® GTX 1050 graphics card with the latest and greatest Pascal™ architecture, so you can blaze through your most intensive tasks.” XPS 15 dell Share Older Samsung Notebook 9 come with better CPUs and desktop-level storage Newer iPhone 7 Plus owners, your cameras could suffer from hardware issues Related Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro hardware specs reveal a quad-core CPU and powerful GPU 23/12/2016 Gadgets iPhone 7 Plus owners, your cameras could suffer from hardware issues 23/12/2016 iPhone Samsung Notebook 9 come with better CPUs and desktop-level storage 20/12/2016 Gadgets You might have to pay more to purchase a Galaxy S8 20/12/2016 Smartphones Microsoft’s Surface Studio components are quite easy to upgrade, if you possess the skills 20/12/2016 Gadgets LeEco has introduced a OnePlus 3T competitor called the Cool S1 20/12/2016 Smartphones How to Lower Your Mobile Data Usage 19/12/2016 Technology Yahoo Hacked: 1-Billion Users Data Sold for $300K 17/12/2016 Technology Latest Influencer Marketing Hub is the leading Business Resource for many things Influencer Marketing 24/12/2016 iPhone Xiaomi Mi Notebook Pro hardware specs reveal a quad-core CPU and powerful GPU 23/12/2016 Gadgets iPhone 7 Plus owners, your cameras could suffer from hardware issues 23/12/2016 iPhone Samsung Notebook 9 come with better CPUs and desktop-level storage 20/12/2016 Gadgets You might have to pay more to purchase a Galaxy S8 20/12/2016 Smartphones Microsoft’s Surface Studio components are quite easy to upgrade, if you possess the skills 20/12/2016 Gadgets LeEco has introduced a OnePlus 3T competitor called the Cool S1 20/12/2016 Smartphones How to Lower Your Mobile Data Usage 19/12/2016 Technology Submit Your App For Review Advertise Contact About Follow
TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud Reviews Chuwi LapBook review Hands on: Chuwi LapBook review Not yet rated By Desire Athow Laptops and netbooks  A budget notebook that hits all the right notes Shares What is a hands on review? Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict The Chuwi LapBook is not an outstanding laptop, by any means, but at this budget price level you’ll be hard pressed to find anything that can compete with it. For Surprisingly long battery life 5V power supply Against Lack of connectors Proprietary power port The recent months have seen several laptops that get their inspiration from Apple’s iconic MacBook range. The Jumper EZBook 2 looks like a 13-inch MacBook Air while the Xiaomi Air 12 borrows heavily from the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro. Chinese vendor Chuwi follows that trend with the LapBook, a notebook that sharply differs from the competition in physical terms. Firstly, it adopts a white finish throughout (except for the screen bezel and the keyboard), then there’s the fact that it uses a 15.6-inch display, and finally, it is one of the very few devices to use a 5V adaptor, the same as your smartphone or tablet. Indeed we’ve successfully managed to power it using a standard charger, although sadly, Chuwi engineers opted for a proprietary connector rather than the ubiquitous microUSB port. There are two models of the LapBook available with the only difference being the processor and the price. The better value of the two is the model based on Intel’s Z8300 CPU which retails for £149 (around $185, AU$250) at the time of writing. The one based on the slightly beefier Z8350 sells for around a third more. Both are currently available from Gearbest (who also provided us with the sample for this hands-on review) on pre-order. (These costs are exclusive of any taxes that may be levied by HMRC or the courier companies on behalf of the vendor. Want to buy tech from online Chinese retailers? Read this first.) As expected, the laptop has a slightly tapered profile; not as pronounced as the MacBook Air but still significant enough. It does look like a larger version of the Asus EEE PC Seashell, a netbook launched in 2009 that had similar but softer lines. The chassis might be plastic but it is of the posher, polished variety. There’s no flex under any circumstance, either with the screen or keyboard and that’s partly because of how big the LapBook is. This is a hefty enough piece of kit, weighing 1.86kg with dimensions of 371 x 240 x 22mm. Oddly enough it comes with a tiny power supply unit, a 15W (5V3A) model which can also be used to charge your smartphone should you feel the need to. Open the notebook up and you’ll find a massive 15.6-inch Full HD display with a decent size keyboard and a larger than average touchpad, one which has a slightly granular texture. The power button is tucked away on the top right-hand side and that’s not what one would call a good decision, especially as it is located next to the delete button – meaning there’s an unnecessary danger of shutting down the laptop accidentally. There’s some better news in the form of the display, with the IPS screen being more than adequate having uniform brightness across the surface and no significant bleed. The keys on the keyboard have a good amount of travel, not surprising given the thickness of the device, and they offer sharp feedback. It is a shame though that Chuwi didn’t opt for a full-size keyboard with a separate numeric keypad, something that would have set this device apart from the competition. We were surprised (and disappointed) to find out that it has only two USB ports (one of which is USB 3.0). There’s also a microSD card reader, a mini-HDMI port, an audio jack and a proprietary power connector.  Inside the LapBook the hardware consists of the usual suspects, a triumvirate of components that have become part and parcel of all the entry-level Windows-based systems we’ve reviewed over the past 12 months. As we previously mentioned, there’s an Intel Atom x5-Z8300, a quad-core CPU based on Cherry Trail and clocked at 1.44GHz. It is accompanied by 4GB of low power DDR3 memory and 64GB of eMMC flash storage, all of which is resolutely entry-level. You also get 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, two speakers (and what appears to be two microphones) and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera to round things off. As expected, Windows was pre-registered, something we strongly discourage and absolutely do not condone. Why Chinese retailers engage in this practice is beyond us. As for performance, just make sure you adjust your expectations given the hardware inside. This laptop is great for lightweight tasks, but it struggles when having to deal with more than a few tabs in Microsoft’s Edge browser, for example. The benchmarks below show how it performs across a series of popular test applications. What surprised us was the fact that across a number of benchmarks, the laptop scored higher (i.e. performed better) when using battery power as opposed to being plugged in. Battery life was better than expected, indeed far better than expected at nearly eight hours (yes, eight hours). Granted, we were testing using a simple video of a clock with brightness on 50%, but this certainly still counts as an impressive result. Note that the charger was a 15W one so it took longer to charge the bigger-than-average 10,000mAh battery. And further note that the battery, as is the case on most entry-level laptops, is not removable. The speakers were underwhelming to say the least; the sound coming out of these was devoid of any character, lacking depth and oomph. But that’s pretty much as expected with a device in this price bracket. Early verdict Despite sporting a name that will attract all sorts of comments, the LapBook left a positive impression on us. A cheap price – remember it costs only £150 (around $185, AU$250) – coupled with a very likable, distinctive design, a large 15.6-inch Full HD display, and a tiny power supply make it a winner for those on a budget. We just wished it had more connectors and dropped that proprietary power socket. Oh, and don’t fork out extra for the faster processor, the price difference is far too big to justify the jump in performance.  The only real competition at this price is the slightly more expensive Jumper EZBook 2 which looks even more like a Macbook Air and shares the exact same specification as the LapBook, bar the battery.

These companies are investing billions to be on the leading edge in their fields. Bradley Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Dec 26, 2016 at 11:31AM Staying relevant through constant innovation and disruption is more important in the tech industry than in arguably any other sector. By investing heavily in research and development (R&D), these companies are making expensive bets on the future and what technology and trends will lead it -- along with their own sales and profits.  Image source: Getty Images. 6 companies investing billions in R&D To compile this list, we looked at the total dollar amount that publicly traded tech companies have each spent on R&D over the past year. There are many companies investing heavily in R&D, both by real dollar amount and also relative to their own market cap., but here are the six companies that stood out as shaping the future based on how much they have invested, and will probably continue to do so, to be the ones at the forefront of future development. Company Market Cap R&D Spend (Previous 12 Months) Alphabet Inc. $531 billion $13.8 billion Intel Corporation  $176 billion $13 billion Microsoft Corporation $468 billion $12.1 billion Apple Inc. $582 billion $10 billion Oracle Corporation $159 billion $6.5 billion Cisco Systems, Inc. $148 billion $6.3 billion Data source: Capital IQ What those billions are going after It's not surprising that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) tops the list as the biggest investor in the in the world in terms of R&D spend. Alphabet's willingness to spend heavily on research into areas such as self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, and wearable technology such as Google Glass and connected clothing shows how the company is working to assure it has a place in the world far beyond the internet search that currently makes up the vast majority of its revenue. Alphabet's recent restructuring to make Google one segment of the overall company was specifically designed to allow the company to continue making audacious moonshot bets.   Alphabet's self-driving car project, now called Waymo. Image source: Alphabet/Waymo. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently announced that it will release a device to compete in the smart-home space. Powered by its Cortana voice-enabled artificial intelligence platform, this device will compete directly with similar products such as Google Home. Other big investments in the past few years from Microsoft include cloud computing and more work on its Windows operating system for mobile devices and as an "Internet of Things" platform. It's yet to be seen how Microsoft's recent acquisition of LinkedIn will fully play out, but you can expect that it links up with some of the areas Microsoft has been investing heavily in already.   Intel, Oracle, and Cisco Systems are each working hard to keep their industry-dominating positions from younger and more fast-paced companies within the microprocessor, graphic chip, and computing network space. These three behemoth companies have been building and developing infrastructure for cloud computing, internet security, and other digital-age network services that require new technology far beyond what their own technology could handle in years past. Building and preparing for these big growth trends in such a fast-moving segment of the IT industry will like drive higher R&D spending in these companies for years to come.  Finally, there's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). This company has been the focus of much analysis in the past few years for not releasing enough new and astonishing tech, so much so that many of those analysts have questioned if Apple's growth days are behind it. However, the company is one of the biggest investors in R&D, seemingly going after the connected-car market, artificial intelligence, or other long-term investments such as building much more comprehensive software platforms. What makes Apple especially interesting is that it's by far the wealthiest company on the list by total cash value, which was a record of nearly $238 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in its most recent quarter. That's more than double the cash of second-place Microsoft, with $117 billion.   Preparing for bigger spending to come If those numbers don't already look massive enough, they could get bigger in the coming years. Apple's $238 billion in cash? The vast majority of that amount is stored offshore, where Apple is holding it because the company doesn't want to pay the around 35% corporate tax to repatriate it back to the United States. As part of a tax system overhaul, President-elect Donald Trump has said he seeks to lower this corporate tax rate and could even provide a special 10% tax for companies that are seeking to repatriate a huge chunk of cash back to the States. The richest companies in the U.S., then, including many of the companies in the preceding list, would probably then repatriate much of that cash and could put the money to work in increased R&D spending.  Like much of the potential changes coming to corporate tax or other policy, there's no telling when this might happen, what the final numbers will be, how much each of that overseas cash each company would bring back, or what the companies will do with the money. Still, either way, these companies and many like them are likely to continue spending heavily on researching and developing the next wave of new technology that will drive their industries in the years ahead -- something that long-term investors won't want to miss.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

By Matt Asay | December 26, 2016, 5:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/Sashkinw Machine learning and artificial intelligence are all the rage today in venture capital circles. We've seen spectacular exits in the past few years, from Google absorbing Deepmind in 2014 for $500 million, to Twitter buying TellApart in 2015 for $533 million, and Intel swallowing Nervana in 2016 for $400 million. But these were all IT plays. What happens when machine learning meets biology? Berkeley-based Lygos is engineering and designing microbes that convert low-cost sugar into high-value, specialty chemicals. At the core, they're developing and exploiting a number of tools, both software and hardware, and applying them to biology. Ultimately, the ability to design and optimize microbes, or program them, is becoming faster and cheaper than ever before. This is being fueled by cutting-edge advances in data science and biotech, and the rapidly dropping cost of reading, writing, and editing DNA (a trend that's even faster than Moore's Law for computing). In other words, the latest advances in software, big data, machine learning, biotech, and chemistry may be combining to quite possibly start a new industrial revolution. A new spin on machine learning Cloudera co-founder Jeff Hammerbacher once declared, "The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click Ads. That sucks." He was right about the "suckiness," but perhaps some of those best minds are working on things that are far more substantial in their impact. SEE Big data's biggest impact is not on Silicon Valley More about Big Data 5 new books on all things data and tech The hottest new big data analytics jobs you need to know The battle for Apache Cassandra highlights major problem with open source projects Hiring kit: Microsoft Power BI developer Take, for example, Eric Steen, co-founder and CEO of Lygos, an interesting new startup that aims to become the next DuPont, but not in the traditional way. Lygos develops microbes to convert sugar into high-value specialty chemicals, focusing its flagship product on malonic acid (derived from petroleum), which is used in a diverse set of industries, including flavor and fragrance, electronic manufacturing, and coatings. But, how Lygos got to this point is what makes it interesting. Microbes have evolved over millions of years to become hyper-efficient factories. A microbe has amazing computational and machine learning ability because so much is written into the genetic code. Evolution is nature's machine learning algorithm. Lygos is unlocking the ability to control and guide evolution to reprogram a microbe to produce its products. A microbe can do a computation every time it divides and grows itself, which it does every 20 minutes. Lygos has millions of them going in a single vat at a time. Using technology that harnesses evolution, they have a more powerful machine-learning platform in nature than a computer could ever deliver, and are developing and deploying a range of these technologies to design microbial factories. Data science beyond Silicon Valley This is important, super-cool stuff, and it's yet another reason to look beyond Silicon Valley for the most interesting innovations. In the case of Lygos, it's based in the Valley, but its impact is not. SEE: Machine learning: The smart person's guide I've written before about John Deere revolutionizing farming through big data, and continue to believe the most important work in data is not happening within 45 miles of San Francisco. As McKinsey & Co. has noted, industries like manufacturing and retail have huge incentives to embrace data science and plenty of data to work with. And, though they will borrow tech from the titans of Silicon Valley (e.g., TensorFlow from Google), and cloud vendors like AWS will lower the bar for developers dipping their toes into machine learning, the biggest impact of big data will not go toward ad-clicking strategies.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid When it comes to the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date, details are still hazy. The device could be released in the spring of 2017; at least that’s what tech enthusiasts believe. The Surface Pro 4 released in October 2015. Therefore, the Surface Pro 5 was expected in October 2016. However, Microsoft released the Surface Book i7 and Surface Studio in that month. The Microsoft Windows 10 Creators Update will happen during spring next year. Hence, everybody is expecting the Surface Pro 5 to be released along with the Windows 10 update. Like the release date, the price of the highly-anticipated device remains a mystery though it is expected to be priced as its predecessor, depending on the configuration, writes Tech Times. The Surface Pro 4 was released to replace the laptop. Therefore, the Surface Pro 5 could sport even more impressive specs and features to take it to the next level. Microsoft has recently gone into a deal with Qualcomm and has also shown the Windows 10 on an ARM processor. This means there is a high possibility that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will pack a quality Snapdragon chipset and not an Intel processor. An improved battery and LTE connectivity are also anticipated in the product. However, if the portability factor is taken into consideration, then an Intel chip will perhaps make more sense. Microsoft’s Surface Pro line has always aimed at providing desktop-like power combined with the portability of a laptop. Thus, one Surface Pro 5 with an Intel chip and another with a Snapdragon chipset are also highly possible. A lot has been said about the Stylus being made compatible with the device. A rechargeable battery can charge the stylus wirelessly when docked to the tablet. While a 2K screen is anticipated in the Surface Pro 5, a higher end model with 4K capabilities is also reportedly being considered, writes NEUROGADGET. The USB Type-C ports could be used instead of USB 3.0 ports. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 device.

BUSINESS 3 Chinese nationals charged with using hacked emails for insider trading Preet Bharara Mark Lennihan / Associated Press U.S. Atty. Preet Bharara U.S. Atty. Preet Bharara (Mark Lennihan / Associated Press) Associated Press Federal prosecutors have charged three Chinese nationals accused of gaining insider information about mergers and acquisitions by hacking into the networks of law firms working on the deals, then profiting from that information, authorities said Tuesday. The three men made more than $4 million in profits by buying stock in companies that were about to be acquired and then selling the shares after the acquisitions were announced, U.S. Atty. Preet Bharara said. Prosecutors say the three got the insider information between April 2014 and late 2015 by hacking into the email systems of multiple international law firms with offices in New York. One defendant, Iat Hong, was arrested Monday in Hong Kong and is awaiting extradition. Two others, Bo Zheng and Chin Hung, had not been arrested as of late Tuesday. All three are being charged with multiple counts of securities fraud, insider trading, computer intrusion and other offenses. They face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charges. “This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: You are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information available to would-be criminals,” Bharara said in a statement. FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said the bureau “works around the clock to keep these types of alleged securities fraudsters and cyber criminals from trading on stolen information.” Information about defense attorneys for the defendants wasn't immediately available. The defendants profited from deals including the acquisition of e-commerce company Borderfree by Pitney Bowes Inc. and Intel Corp.’s acquisition of circuit manufacturer Altera Corp., according to the indictment. Both were completed in 2015. Prosecutors say Hong and Hung used insider information to buy 113,000 shares of Borderfree in the week before the Pitney Bowes-Borderfree transaction was made public May 6, 2015. They made a profit of about $841,000 when they sold their Borderfree shares May 18, 2015. The law firms that worked on the deals and allegedly were targeted are not named in the indictment.  Caption 90 seconds: Goodbye to 2016. Hello, 2017 The end of 2016 will be a wet one in L.A.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 2, 2017 Ken Shirriff Takes Us Inside the IC, For Fun 13 Comments by: Elliot Williams December 27, 2016 [Ken Shirriff] has seen the insides of more integrated circuits than most people have seen bellybuttons. (This is an exaggeration.) But the point is, where we see a crazy jumble of circuitry, [Ken] sees a riddle to be solved, and he’s got a method that guides him through the madness. In his talk at the 2016 Hackaday SuperConference, [Ken] stepped the audience through a number of famous chips, showing how he approaches them and how you could do the same if you wanted to, or needed to. Reading an IC from a photo is not for the faint of heart, but with a little perseverance, it can give you the keys to the kingdom. We’re stoked that [Ken] shared his methods with us, and gave us some deeper insight into a handful of classic silicon, from the Z80 processor to the 555 timer and LM7805 voltage regulator, and beyond. Dive In: The Z80 [Ken] wastes no time and dives straight into a die shot of the Z80 8-bit CPU. He starts out by labeling the landing pads that connect to external pins by cross-referencing them with the datasheet. That tells you a lot — you know what the pins have to do, so it makes guessing use for each clusters of transistors a lot easier. When you see a bunch of repeated tiny circuits, you’re probably looking at memory. Since the Z80 has sixteen registers in its CPU, [Ken] goes looking for sixteen repeating blocks of storage, and finds ’em (lower-left). Since they’re connected up to the address lines on the pin-pads, he’s doubly-confirming his hunch. The other side of the registers heads off to a data bus, another giveaway. The command decoder turns out to be a programmable logic array (PLA) that takes a bit pattern in across horizontal wires, matches it, and then sends a logic high down a vertical line that leads to the Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU). Particular to the Z80, [Ken] notes that although it takes eight-bit instructions, it’s only four bits wide. It turns out the CPU memory-speed constrained, so they saved space (and money) by using a four-bit ALU. Sneaky! Once he’s figured out the broad outlines of the chip, it’s time to dig down into the transistors. After a brief intro to designing logic circuits out of transistors, he takes us into the actual fabric of the IC. As if things weren’t confusing enough with simple logic gates like NAND and NOR, it turns out that the designers of the Z80 used a few “crazy gates” that efficiently compute particular operations that they needed. The ALU is the heart of a chip, and it’s highly optimized. For instance, the Z80’s ALU is “totally different” from the 6502. An adder is not just an adder. And it’s here in the ALU that you’ll find crazy gates and chip-specific implementations. Figuring out how all that works is the next level up for budding chip-reading detectives. [Ken] has a lot more on the Z80 on his website. Clever Calculators and Forgotten Memories The Sinclair Scientific Calculator from 1974 was a small marvel: it took a TI chip from a simple calculator “that could barely multiply” and added on logs and trig functions. How did Sinclair do it? [Ken] wanted to find out — we still hold this as one of our most favorite hacks. Starting off again with the pinout, [Ken] finds his way to the instruction ROM. He built a software simulator for what he found, and got to reverse-engineering. Again, if you’re into clever space-saving algorithms, head on over to his website. In 1970, RAM storage was incredibly expensive. Intel came out with “shift-register” memory, and indeed, it’s just a 512-bit-long shift register. How does random access work in this context? You wait until your bit comes around like you would on a baggage carousel — leading to slow and random random-access times. Cool. But we can also see why they went out of favor. Analog ICs: the 555 timer, the LM741, and the LM7805 Have you ever used a 555 timer? Want to see how it works? First, you’ll have to understand the implementation details of the bipolar-junction transistors (BJTs). Although BJTs are laid-out in many more different topologies than their FET cousins, analog circuits are often smaller and easier to get your head around. [Ken] gives you a good head start, and then starts off reversing two iconic chips: the 555 timer and the LM741 op-amp. The 741 IC is dominated by an in-silicon capacitor, which really is a silly idea, but since “engineers are lazy” and this means that they have one less piece to lay out, it turned out to be worth its weight in gold and the LM741 sold bazillions. On the other hand, it’s got current mirrors spread around everywhere, which are used to replace resistors in silicon. And it’s got some strange transistors, one of which has six (!) collectors because the designers needed six current mirrors in one place. Finally, [Ken] takes apart the LM7805 voltage regulator. The output transistor is (not surprisingly) about half of the IC die — the 7805 needs to push some current. The coolest part of the chip is a variable resistor that sets the output voltage. It’s a simple trick that makes the difference between an LM7812 and an LM7805 no more than the value of the resistor inside, leveraging the same design for different operating voltages. How Does He Do It? [Ken] uses a metallurgical microscope that shines its light from above, rather than through the sample. He got his for a few hundred dollars on eBay. He then takes multiple images from different locations all around the chip, with significant overlap, and lets the Hugin software stitch it all back together for him. “The experts” decap their chips using boiling sulfuric or nitric acid. [Ken] doesn’t need a Superfund site, so he often leaves the die photos to someone else. Sites like zeptobars.com, visual6502, and siliconpr0n have a ton of chips that are just waiting for you to start decoding, with no chemistry degree needed. For chips that aren’t in epoxy, [Ken] opens them by himself either by hitting them with a chisel or cutting open with a saw. He’s just now started up on the 8008 CPU. Between this talk and the resources on [Ken]’s website, you’ve got a good head start. All that’s left to do is the good, hard, fun work of puzzling out a few ICs on your own.

Neither is pretty but both remove a lot of material in a hurry. Report comment Reply Ward says: December 27, 2016 at 8:13 pm Does it really make sense to slag an integrated circuit for being, well, integrated? The capacitor on the 741 is 25pF. Nowadays you can get that with half a nanohenry or so of parasitic inductance if you use an 0201 part and good layout practices. In 1968? Probably two orders of magnitude higher once you consider lead parasitics on the IC and cap, not to mention the layout. And it would be *much* lower Q than an on-die part. That leads to incredibly poor, highly variable loop compensation. Not conducive to a very robust design, which is what an integrated circuit hoped to facilitate. No IC designer burns silicon for fun, every bit of die area is scrutinized and must be defended in multiple design reviews. There’s no way that capacitor is there simply to accommodate laziness on the part of the customer.

Compared to that, a capacitor seems nothing. Report comment Reply Steven Gann says: December 28, 2016 at 11:54 am I mean, sure I could use a $5 8-bit MCU, write out a few hundred lines of boilerplate, implement a whole USB stack, write my 5 lines of actual application logic, flash it all with a $500 programmer, and then solder it onto some stripboard with voltage regulators, level shifters, resistors, and capacitors, then write USB drivers for every OS I want to work with and install those drivers on every PC I need to plug it into. …or I could use a $5 Arduino and have something working in less than an hour. It’s not about being lazy, and those transistors aren’t “wasted”. It’s about putting together a solution in a day instead of a month. Some of us have jobs and can’t devote weeks to building a gadget. I have thee jobs and can devote all of maybe 4 hours/week at my workbench. When I’m designing a commercial product, I am more efficient in my choice of components and I do use the smallest MCU suitable, write crap-tons of boilerplate, and flash the MCU with a $500 programmer. When I’m trying to make my TV’s remote control Plex, I’m not going to spend more than $10 and 2 hours getting it to work so an Arduino is a perfect fit. Sure I COULD use a PIC or even a bunch of 555s, and yes I’m using a recycled IR receiver with integrated pullup and filter cap which I could build myself, but my time is a bit more valuable than that. Report comment Reply Greenaum says: December 29, 2016 at 12:35 am Yup. The transistors on an IC aren’t valuable any more. People “waste” billions of them playing Pokemon or posting nonsense on web forums. If it costs a couple of quid, and does exactly what you want, it makes sense to use an MCU over a dedicated chip. Who’s supposed to be keeping count of these “wasted” transistors? Same way it’s not worth repairing TVs and radios any more. Technology has advanced enough, that things formerly rare and valuable are now disposable. And that generally makes life better! Hooray! Report comment Reply Gravis says: December 27, 2016 at 8:27 pm It would be nice if someone made an application that applied some CV to microscope video streams to create perfect die shots and then further processed the image into simple bitmap images of each layer. Kind of a niche software but it would make it much easier for people just starting to RE old ICs.

I never heard of “shift register memory” but it makes sense as an interim technology before manufacturing techniques advanced far enough to make RAM affordable. The first thing like it that popped in my mind was magnetic bubble memory, followed by “delay-line memory”, and CCD’s which all sequential-access electronic memory devices. Report comment Reply Ostracus says: December 28, 2016 at 9:12 am Those links will be very useful. Also chip photos have a beauty all their own. Some even resemble a top-down city. Report comment Reply Ben Thar says: December 28, 2016 at 9:40 am “resemble a top-down city” It shouldn’t surprise you to know that a part of VLSI design emphasizes “Manhattan Based Design Rules”. By restricting the chip geometries to only rectangles composed of horizontal and vertical lines, the layout software is greatly simplified. Design Rule Checkers are also much simpler for “Manhattan” designs than for designs with random shaped polygons, circles, and lines at arbitrary angles.

Before you go, we thought you'd like these... READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Ben Gilbert Dec 27th 2016 2:30PM Apple, unlike any other company in the world, is directly tied to one individual: Steve Jobs. Without question, Jobs was the driving force that turned Apple into the world's most valuable tech company. But Jobs didn't do it alone. He always had a team of talented people helping him build Apple. Sadly, many of them have been forgotten — which is why we've gathered information on the first 10 employees at the company. Apple's first CEO, Michael Scott, gave us a bunch of color on the early days, and Steve Wozniak helped with a list of early employees, though it was based on his memory. We got our full list from another early employee. The Apple employee numbers aren't the order each person joined the company. When Scott came to Apple, he had to give out numbers to each employee to make life easier for the payroll department. Jay Yarow contributed to an earlier version of this story. 10. Gary Martin was in charge of accounting Martin thought Apple was going to flop, but joined the company anyway. He stayed at Apple until 1983. From Apple he jumped to Starstruck, a company working on space travel. For the next few decades he moved from one CFO position to another at a few companies. 9. Sherry Livingston was the right hand for Apple's first CEO Livingston was the first secretary at Apple, and she did a lot. Michael Scott, who hired her, said she basically did all the odds and ends work for Apple in the early days.

It was the first Apple machine to incorporate a built-in 5.25 inch floppy disk drive and high-resolution graphics built into the motherboard. Unfortunately the machines suffered from numerous problems and sold poorly. An improved and lower-priced Apple III was launched in 1981, followed by a III+ in 1983, but the computers continued to be unpopular, and production ceased in 1985.

Chris Espinosa was working at Apple part-time in high school — and he still works there! Chris Espinosa joined Apple when he was 14, and still in high school. He's still with the company today — he's actually Apple's longest-serving employee at this point. On his personal blog he said he ended up as employee No. 8 because when CEO Michael "Scotty" Scott was giving out numbers, he was at school. He arrived late and ended up with the "wrong" number. Sorry Chris! 7. Michael "Scotty" Scott was the original CEO Scott told us he gave himself No. 7, as a joke. It's a reference to James Bond — 007. Scotty, as he was known, picked all the numbers for employees and organized the company. He was brought in as CEO by Mike Markkula, the man who invested $250,000 in Apple and helped map out its business plan. 6. Randy Wigginton ended up working for several important tech companies Wigginton's main job was to rewrite BASIC so it would work for the Apple II, Michael Scott told us in an interview. BASIC is an early programming language — the stuff at the core of computing. In his post-Apple life he's worked at eBay, Google, Chegg, and Square, among others. Not a bad run! 5. Rod Holt was super important in the development of the Apple II Holt was a highly regarded designer who was skeptical of joining Apple initially. But, in "Return To The Little Kingdom," he says Steve Jobs "conned" him into taking the job. Holt helped develop the power supply for the Apple II. After six years at Apple, Holt says he was pushed out of the company by new management. 4. Bill Fernandez was the first employee after the two Steves Bill Fernandez first met Steve Jobs at Cupertino Junior High School when Jobs was a new student. Fernandez was also a neighbor and friend of Steve Wozniak. Here's how Fernandez describes it on his LinkedIn profile: "Introduced the founders, Woz and Jobs. Was later hired by them as Apple's first employee. Occupied many positions, first in hardware, later in software, and finally in user interface design. Worked on the Apple-1, Apple-2, Macintosh and other hardware projects. Worked on the MacOS, QuickTime, HyperCard and other software projects." When Jobs and Wozniak started Apple, they hired Fernandez as the first employee. He stayed with Apple until 1993, when he left to work at Ingres, a database company. He currently works as CEO at a company named Omnibiotics. 3. Mike Markkula was the moneyman Markkula was as instrumental in developing Apple as either of the two Steves. He made an investment in Apple worth $250,000. In exchange for his investment, he took 30% of the company. He also helped manage the company, develop a business plan, hired the first CEO, and insisted Steve Wozniak join Apple. (At the time he was thinking about joining HP.) Markkula was an early Intel employee and became a millionaire by the time he was 30 when the company went public. According to "Return to the Little Kingdom," his investment in Apple was less than 10% of his total worth at the time. He stayed at Apple until 1997, overseeing the ouster and return of Steve Jobs. When Jobs came back, Markkula left. He has since invested in a few startups and donated money to Santa Clara University, for the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. 2. Steve Jobs became employee "Number 2," just to irk him Why is Jobs employee No. 2 and not No. 1? Michael Scott says, "I didn't give it to Jobs because I thought that would be too much." Jobs, as is well known, was ousted from Apple, created a new startup called NeXT, then came back and returned Apple to glory (when Apple bought NeXT). In between, he led Pixar. Steve Jobs died in October 2011. 1. Steve Wozniak was the technical expert Wozniak almost didn't join Apple. He had a job offer at HP in Oregon and was considering taking it. He made the right choice, clearly. Years later, "Woz" (as he's known) is still a regular face in Silicon Valley — he gives interviews, speeches, and has even appeared on "Dancing with the Stars." BONUS: Ronald Wayne decided to sell his shares for $1,700 Ronald Wayne was an original partner in Apple with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, but decided the business wasn't for him. He left. To make things official, Markkula bought out his stake in the company for $1,700 in 1977. In 2012, Wayne wrote an essay on why he left Apple. It's quite good: "I didn't separate myself from Apple because of any lack of enthusiasm for the concept of computer products. Aside from any immediate apprehension in regard to financial risks, I left because I didn't feel that this new enterprise would be the working environment that I saw for myself, essentially for the rest of my days. I had every belief [it] would be successful but I didn't know when, what I'd have to give up or sacrifice to get there, or how long it would take to achieve that success. ... To counter much that has been written in the press about me as of late, I didn't lose out on billions of dollars. That's a long stretch between 1976 and 2012. Apple went through a lot of hard times and many thought Apple would simply go out of business at various times in its maturity. I perhaps lost tens of millions of dollars. And quite honestly, between just you and me, it was character building."

But there's one that can: Brainwave Science, a Southborough, Mass.,-based provider of "brain fingerprinting" technology it says can be used to boost border security and counter-terrorism. This past Friday, Bloomberg brought up these connections with a story titled "Trump Aide Partnered With Firm Run by Man With Alleged KGB Ties." The Trump aide in question is Michael Flynn, who joined Brainwave's board of advisers in February and who was named as Trump's national security adviser in November. The man with alleged KGB ties is Subu Kota, one of Brainwave's two directors, though his name has since been scrubbed from Brainwave's board director page. (It appears here in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.) Related This Startup Is Helping Fight Against Trump's False Voter Fraud Claims Flynn's connections to Brainwave and Kota are being called into question as Flynn faces widespread criticism for his close ties to Russia. Trump has also been under scrutiny for the coziness between himself, his aides and Russia's government. 'Brain fingerprinting' tech Brainwave's brain fingerprinting technology is based on a technique developed by Larry Farwell, a former Harvard research associate. He and Ika have both been listed as founders of Brainwave, which started up in 2012 to sell ready-to-use brain-reading rigs. On the company's website, it calls the tech a "noteworthy advancement from the polygraph" adding that it can detect whether a suspect has knowledge of certain information with 99 percent accuracy. The company advertises its product as a solution that "empowers law enforcement, combats terrorism, safeguards borders and puts criminals behind bars." However, the reliability of Farwell's techniques has been called into question, with the General Accounting Office releasing a report in 2001 saying that the effectiveness of brain fingerprinting could not be validated and that efforts to do so were not worth it. As noted by The Verge last year, a group of researchers called Farwell's research to support the technique "misleading," adding he "misrepresents the scientific status of brain fingerprinting technology." Ika, Brainwave's president, told Bloomberg that the company is looking for investors and that it has not sold its products to U.S. federal agencies yet. If it has raised any outside funding, there's no sign of that in the usual places (Crunchbase, AngelList and EDGAR). Near the beginning of last year, Ika told The Verge that the company was in negotiations with six countries who were interested in the tech's applications for counter-terrorism screening. Ties with Flynn A spokesman for Trump's transition team told Bloomberg that Flynn never spoke with Kota — who was once convicted for attempts to sell stolen biotech material to the KGB — and that Flynn has ended his association with Brainwave. The company's president, Krishna Ika, told Bloomberg that Flynn met with Brainwave at least 10 times and that Flynn had signed agreements with Brainwave to help sell its product to U.S. agencies, as well as train any agencies for the product's use. Flynn has been running his own private consulting group, Flynn Intel Group, after he was fired in 2014 as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency by President Barack Obama over policy disagreements. Ika said Brainwave's collaboration with Flynn has been on hold since Trump won the election and named Flynn as his national security adviser, adding that there are now negotiations to possibly bring on other partners from Flynn Intel Group. Ties with KGB Brainwave Sciences' brain fingerprinting headset. Photo via company's website. With Kota no longer listed as a board director of Brainwave's website, it's not clear what his current status with the company is. The company did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning. Kota, who runs an IT consulting firm called The Boston Group, pleaded guilty in 1996 over the sale of stolen biotech material to a federal agent who was posing as a KGB spy. He also acknowledged that he had traded information about technology related to U.S. missile defense systems in exchange for money with a KGB spy who he thought was a businessman at the time. Kota also said he thought the information he provided at the time came from public sources. Bloomberg noted that Kota received a "reduced sentence of four year's probation and a $50,000 fine" in the biotech case after he agreed to testify against Vladimir Galkin, the man who was Kota's co-defendant and turned out to be a KGB spy.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated December 27, 2016 10:15AM SHARE ALSO SEE Tech Trends Cloud Computing Cybersecurity Cybercrime Ransomware CRM Collaboration Self-Driving Cars Artificial Intelligence Virtual Reality Augmented Reality Top Tech News Over the course of 2016, businesses, governments and individuals alike saw both new threats and new opportunities emerge as information technologies continued to advance. One top trend -- the growing number of cybersecurity attacks -- already causes trillions of dollars in losses, with the damage expected to hit $6 billion by 2021, according to a recent report from Cybersecurity Ventures. Meanwhile, continued developments in cloud computing along with accelerating advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in 2016 increased pressure on organizations to transform for the new digital business era. Other tech trends that led the news and the markets this year included ongoing improvements in self-driving car technology, more widespread adoption of wearable computing devices and advances in virtual-reality (VR) and augmented-reality technologies. Cybercrime Getting Worse Financial fallout and other impacts from cybercrime continued to rise dramatically in 2016, with Russia's links to pro-Trump hacking dominating headlines in the wake of November's U.S. presidential election. Other major hacks revealed this year included attacks on Dropbox and Yahoo, the last of which still threatens to deep-six Verizon's acquisition plans for that company. The use of ransomware, such as Locky, also intensified. Earlier this month, the security firm Malwarebytes reported that the U.S. in particular was a prime target for such attacks, accounting for 26 percent of all ransomware incidents globally. The growing market for consumer security prompted IT security giant Symantec to announce in November that it was acquiring the identity theft protection firm LifeLock for $2.3 billion. Artificial Intelligence Getting Smarter Almost all of the major technology companies made big announcements related to artificial intelligence in 2016. For instance, when Google announced the launch of its new Pixel and Pixel XL Android smartphones in October, CEO Sundar Pichair said the devices' new built-in smarts heralded the shift from a mobile-first world to one led by AI. Apple, which recently published its first research paper on AI, said its updated operating system, iOS 10, which came out in the fall, would give its customers new levels of artificial intelligence-enabled computing capabilities. Over the past 12 months, Microsoft revealed that it would be collaborating with Intel to develop new AI features for customers, Facebook took the wraps off a new deep-learning system called Caffe2Go that can digitize videos in near-real time and Samsung said its next flagship phone would come with a built-in intelligent digital assistant. And in September, a number of companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft, launched a new non-profit called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society. Self-Driving Cars Advancing Transportation also continued to get smarter in 2016, with both car makers and technology companies aiming at the market for autonomous vehicles. Uber generated plenty of headlines over the year, whether it was for acquiring the self-driving truck startup Otto for $680 million in August, or losing its autonomous car testing permit in California after multiple reports about test-related traffic violations. Tesla also sustained a black eye after reports emerged in the summer that one of its customers was killed in a crash while operating its self-driving car technology. However, autonomous car technologies continued advancing, with new products and acquisition announcements from companies, including AMD, Qualcomm, Google parent company Alphabet, Ford and GM, which early in the year invested $500 million in the ride-sharing app company Lyft. Cloud Computing Everywhere The market for cloud-based computing also kept growing in 2016, with the analyst group Gartner Inc. projecting in September that demand for public cloud services alone would expand by more than 17 percent by the end of this year. Cloud adoption was being led by desire for IT modernization, but cost savings, innvation and agility were also reasons for organizations to continue moving to the cloud, according to Gartner. Among the year's top cloud announcements: Google's plan to acquire the API management firm Apigee, revealed in September; a series of new cloud service launches from Salesforce; cloud-based updates from Adobe; a new cloud-first, mobile-first direction for Microsoft's SharePoint business platform; and several major acquisitions by Oracle aimed at boosting that company's position in customer relationship management and cloud services. Converged Infrastructure, Collaboration, VR and More Other 2016 tech trends included an ongoing shift to converged infrastructure with new announcements from Dell, VCE/EMC, Microsoft and Salesforce; growing collaboration capabilities enabled through new offerings from Google, Facebook, Apple and SAP; new software and hardware for wearables from Huawei, Google and Facebook/Oculus; and an emerging generation of virtual- and augmented-reality technologies from companies ranging from Google and Microsoft to Samsung and Intel.

(Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) Chinese traders hacked into the computer systems of U.S. law firms that handle mergers, then used the data for insider trading that generated more than $4 million in illegal profits, federal prosecutors and regulators charged Tuesday. The suspects in the alleged criminal marriage of cyber-hacking and securities fraud targeted at least seven law firms and other entities that handle the sensitive and often lucrative legal work of advising companies pursuing mergers and acquisitions, according to a 13-count superseding indictment unsealed in New York. Operating from April 2014 through late 2015, the alleged scheme ultimately gained access to secret information from two law firms about pending corporate deals, prosecutors charged. The suspects allegedly prized, targeted and gained access to the emails of attorneys directly involved in the deals. Prosecutors charged they exchanged a list of partners who performed such work at one of the firms before hacking into that firm's computer system. Using that information, the suspects allegedly bought stocks in the companies involved in the deals, and ultimately sold the investments at a profit when the mergers or acquisitions were announced. Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a formal statement said the allegations spotlight the vulnerability of highly-sensitive law firm records to the efforts of determined cyber criminals. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," said Bharara, whose office has successfully prosecuted dozens of insider-trading cases. SCRIBD USA v. Iat Hong Et Al. S1 Indictment The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil lawsuit that seeks an asset freeze aimed at preventing the alleged suspects from cashing in on their alleged trading gains. SEC investigators used trading surveillance and analysis to identify the alleged scheme, which was carried out through the use of both U.S. and offshore accounts, said Stephanie Avakian, acting director of the SEC's enforcement division. The defendants include Iat Hong, a resident of Macau who was arrested in Hong Kong on Christmas Day. He is being held pending extradition to the U.S. Prosecutors identified Hong's alleged co-conspirators as Bo Zhen and Chin Hung, and said they remain at large. All three are charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, computer intrusion and other criminal counts. The law firms whose computer systems the suspects allegedly targeted were not identified in the indictment. However, a March report by The Wall Street Journal said federal investigators were examining whether hacking attacks at such prestigious law firms as Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP and Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP involved theft of secret information for use in insider trading. The deals outlined in the charges included the prospective 2014 acquisition of InterMune, a Brisbane, Calif.,-based biotech company. Although the contemplated acquisition was never completed, InterMune ultimately agreed to an $8.3 billion transaction with Swiss biotech giant Roche in Aug. 2014. USA TODAY Roche to buy biotech firm InterMune for $8.3B The suspects allegedly cashed in on the announcement, selling 18,000 InterMune shares they had acquired twelve days before the deal became public for roughly $380,000 in profits, the indictment charges. Similarly, the accused traders in Jan. 2015 allegedly targeted emails of a law firm that had been retained by computer chip giant Intel (INTC) for a contemplated acquisition of chip partner company Altera. According to investigators, the suspects downloaded approximately 2.8 gigabytes of data from the law firm, including records from a law partner working on the deal. The traders amassed more than 210,000 in Altera shares, prosecutors allege. They allegedly sold the shares for roughly $1.4 million in profits — the result of sales carried out days as the Altera shares soared approximately 26% after The Wall Street Journal reported the Intel-Altera talks. Additional cyber hacking of law firms' data yielded secret information that allegedly enabled the suspects to ring up roughly $841,000 in illegal profits from the $395 million deal announced in May 2015 by Stamford, Ct.-based technology company Pitney Bowes (PBI) and Borderfree, a market leader in e-commerce solutions.

The three defendants, two from Macau and one from China, successfully breached the computer networks of international law firms with New York offices by unlawfully obtaining a firm employee's credentials and then installing malware on the server of the law firm, the US Attorney's office in New York said. The malware permitted the hackers to monitor law firm communications about more than a dozen transactions in 2014 and 2015 that were discussed or contemplated, including some deals that were never consummated. Three hackers charged in the US allegedly made $380,000 on trades of Intermune, a drug maker, $1.4 billion in trades on Altera, and $841,000 on Borderfree ©Kirill KUDRYAVTSEV (AFP/File) The hackers then bought shares of companies that would later be acquired, winning great profit. The hackers allegedly made $380,000 on trades of Intermune, a drug maker bought in 2014 by Germany's Roche; $1.4 billion in trades on Altera, which was bought by Intel in 2015; and $841,000 on Borderfree, which was acquired by Pitney Bowls in 2015. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," said US Attorney Preet Bharara. Authorities arrested Iat Hong of Macau in Hong Kong, who is now pending extradition proceedings. The other two defendants, Chin Hung of Macau and Bo Zheng of China, are at large, a spokesman for the US Attorney's office said.

Finance Search Tue, Jan 3, 2017, 1:40 PM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 2 hrs 20 mins Arrest in $4mn US insider trading case from law firm hacksAFP – Tue, Dec 27, 2016 8:00 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Three hackers charged in the US allegedly made $380,000 on trades of Intermune, a drug maker, $1.4 billion in trades on Altera, and $841,000 on Borderfree US prosecutors announced criminal charges Tuesday against three hackers who allegedly made $4 million in illicit profits from insider trading of information pilfered from law firms advising on corporate merger. The three defendants, two from Macau and one from China, successfully breached the computer networks of international law firms with New York offices by unlawfully obtaining a firm employee's credentials and then installing malware on the server of the law firm, the US Attorney's office in New York said. The malware permitted the hackers to monitor law firm communications about more than a dozen transactions in 2014 and 2015 that were discussed or contemplated, including some deals that were never consummated. The hackers then bought shares of companies that would later be acquired, winning great profit. The hackers allegedly made $380,000 on trades of Intermune, a drug maker bought in 2014 by Germany's Roche; $1.4 billion in trades on Altera, which was bought by Intel in 2015; and $841,000 on Borderfree, which was acquired by Pitney Bowls in 2015. "This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world: you are and will be targets of cyber hacking, because you have information valuable to would-be criminals," said US Attorney Preet Bharara. Authorities arrested Iat Hong of Macau in Hong Kong, who is now pending extradition proceedings. The other two defendants, Chin Hung of Macau and Bo Zheng of China, are at large, a spokesman for the US Attorney's office said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » ANZ selling Chinese bank stake for $1.84bnAAP ANZ is continuing to offload Asian assets with the sale of its 20 per cent stake in Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank … Scammers demanding gift cards or bitcoinAAP ANZ offloads Shanghai bank stakeAFP Brazil logs record trade surplus despite troublesAFP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7224 +0.0027 +0.38% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5871 +0.0013 +0.22% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6894 +0.0022 +0.32% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Margot Robbie Car Insurance Test cricket Gabba Free iTunes download Donald Trump Gumtree Aussie weather Gold Coast accommodation Aleppo Cairns Accommodation Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. Top Tech Trends of 2016: The Good, Bad, and Noteworthy By Shirley Siluk / Enterprise Security Today PUBLISHED: DECEMBER 27 2016 Over the course of 2016, businesses, governments and individuals alike saw both new threats and new opportunities emerge as information technologies continued to advance. One top trend -- the growing number of cybersecurity attacks -- already causes trillions of dollars in losses, with the damage expected to hit $6 billion by 2021, according to a recent report from Cybersecurity Ventures. Meanwhile, continued developments in cloud computing along with accelerating advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in 2016 increased pressure on organizations to transform for the new digital business era. Other tech trends that led the news and the markets this year included ongoing improvements in self-driving car technology, more widespread adoption of wearable computing devices and advances in virtual-reality (VR) and augmented-reality technologies. Cybercrime Getting Worse Financial fallout and other impacts from cybercrime continued to rise dramatically in 2016, with Russia's links to pro-Trump hacking dominating headlines in the wake of November's U.S. presidential election. Other major hacks revealed this year included attacks on Dropbox and Yahoo, the last of which still threatens to deep-six Verizon's acquisition plans for that company. The use of ransomware, such as Locky, also intensified. Earlier this month, the security firm Malwarebytes reported that the U.S. in particular was a prime target for such attacks, accounting for 26 percent of all ransomware incidents globally. The growing market for consumer security prompted IT security giant Symantec to announce in November that it was acquiring the identity theft protection firm LifeLock for $2.3 billion. Artificial Intelligence Getting Smarter Almost all of the major technology companies made big announcements related to artificial intelligence in 2016. For instance, when Google announced the launch of its new Pixel and Pixel XL Android smartphones in October, CEO Sundar Pichair said the devices' new built-in smarts heralded the shift from a mobile-first world to one led by AI. Apple, which recently published its first research paper on AI, said its updated operating system, iOS 10, which came out in the fall, would give its customers new levels of artificial intelligence-enabled computing capabilities. Over the past 12 months, Microsoft revealed that it would be collaborating with Intel to develop new AI features for customers, Facebook took the wraps off a new deep-learning system called Caffe2Go that can digitize videos in near-real time and Samsung said its next flagship phone would come with a built-in intelligent digital assistant. And in September, a number of companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft, launched a new non-profit called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society. Self-Driving Cars Advancing Transportation also continued to get smarter in 2016, with both car makers and technology companies aiming at the market for autonomous vehicles. Uber generated plenty of headlines over the year, whether it was for acquiring the self-driving truck startup Otto for $680 million in August, or losing its autonomous car testing permit in California after multiple reports about test-related traffic violations. Tesla also sustained a black eye after reports emerged in the summer that one of its customers was killed in a crash while operating its self-driving car technology. However, autonomous car technologies continued advancing, with new products and acquisition announcements from companies, including AMD, Qualcomm, Google parent company Alphabet, Ford and GM, which early in the year invested $500 million in the ride-sharing app company Lyft. Cloud Computing Everywhere The market for cloud-based computing also kept growing in 2016, with the analyst group Gartner Inc. projecting in September that demand for public cloud services alone would expand by more than 17 percent by the end of this year. Cloud adoption was being led by desire for IT modernization, but cost savings, innvation and agility were also reasons for organizations to continue moving to the cloud, according to Gartner. Among the year's top cloud announcements: Google's plan to acquire the API management firm Apigee, revealed in September; a series of new cloud service launches from Salesforce; cloud-based updates from Adobe; a new cloud-first, mobile-first direction for Microsoft's SharePoint business platform; and several major acquisitions by Oracle aimed at boosting that company's position in customer relationship management and cloud services. Converged Infrastructure, Collaboration, VR and More Other 2016 tech trends included an ongoing shift to converged infrastructure with new announcements from Dell, VCE/EMC, Microsoft and Salesforce; growing collaboration capabilities enabled through new offerings from Google, Facebook, Apple and SAP; new software and hardware for wearables from Huawei, Google and Facebook/Oculus; and an emerging generation of virtual- and augmented-reality technologies from companies ranging from Google and Microsoft to Samsung and Intel.

The SEC’s complaint alleges that Iat Hong, Bo Zheng, and Hung Chin executed a deceptive scheme to hack into the networks of two law firms and steal confidential information pertaining to firm clients that were considering mergers or acquisitions.  According to the SEC’s complaint, the alleged hacking incidents involved installing malware on the law firms’ networks, compromising accounts that enabled access to all email accounts at the firms, and copying and transmitting dozens of gigabytes of emails to remote internet locations.  Hong and Zheng in particular coveted the emails of attorneys involved in mergers and acquisitions as they exchanged a list of partners who performed the work at one of the law firms prior to the hack at that firm. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges. “We used enhanced trading surveillance and analysis capabilities that we developed over the last few years to identify the broad scope of the defendants’ alleged scheme, including the use of both U.S. and offshore accounts to carry it out,” said Stephanie Avakian, Acting Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “This action demonstrates our commitment and effectiveness in rooting out cyber-driven schemes no matter how sophisticated.” “As we allege, the defendants’ ‘hacking to trade’ scheme involved numerous levels of deception as they gained broad access to the nonpublic networks of two law firms, stole confidential information and then used it for substantial personal gain,” said Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement.  “This action marks the end of their alleged deception and serves as a stark reminder to companies and firms that your networks can be vulnerable targets.” According to the SEC’s complaint, Hong, Zheng, and Chin used the stolen confidential information contained in emails to purchase shares in at least three public companies ahead of public announcements about entering into merger agreements.  The SEC alleges that they spent approximately $7.5 million in a one-month period buying shares in semiconductor company Altera Inc. in advance of a 2015 report that it was in talks to be acquired by Intel Corporation.  Within 12 hours of emails being extracted from one of the firms, Hong and Chin allegedly began purchasing shares of e-commerce company Borderfree so aggressively that they accounted for at least 25 percent of the company’s trading volume on certain days in advance of the announcement of a 2015 deal.  Hong and Zheng also allegedly traded in advance of a 2014 merger announcement involving InterMune, a pharmaceutical company. The SEC’s complaint charges Hong, Zheng, and Chin with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and related rules.  The SEC seeks a final judgment ordering them to pay penalties and disgorge ill-gotten gains plus interest and permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws.  Hong’s mother is named as a relief defendant in the SEC’s complaint for the purpose of recovering ill-gotten gains in her accounts resulting from her son’s alleged illicit trading. The SEC’s investigation is continuing, and is being conducted by Jennie B. Krasner, Devon Leppink Staren, and staff in the SEC’s Information Technology Forensics Group with assistance from Wendy Kong.  The case is being supervised by Ricky Sachar and Antonia Chion and the litigation is being led by Britt Biles.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Southern District of New York, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.   Related Materials SEC complaint Back to List Publications Handbook Online Exchange Handbook Trading Places World Exchanges Media & Resources Press Events News FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index Glossary Acronyms White Papers Twitter Legal and About Us About Mondo Visione Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Cookies Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap © Mondo Visione 2017 About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Careers Sitemap Back to Top News RSS Site by Red Ant

The three targeted at least seven major international law firms that had been retained by companies to advise on deals and successfully got into the e-mail accounts of senior lawyers at two of the firms, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday. They profited on deals and speculation involving the drug maker Intermune, chipmaker Intel Corp. and business services company Pitney Bowes Inc., the U.S. said.

Last year, the U.S. broke up an international ring of hackers who allegedly infiltrated the computer servers of PRNewswire Association LLC, Marketwired and Business Wire and stole market-moving press releases before they were published. According to the SEC, the group, which included Ukrainians and a Georgian, made more than $100 million from trading on the information. “This case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world,” Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in the statement. For a QuickTake on Insider Trading, click here. The three men -- Iat Hong and Chin Hung, 50, of Macau, and Bo Zheng, 30, of China -- worked at a robotics company that was started by Zheng, according to the government. Hong, 26, was arrested in Hong Kong on Christmas Day and is awaiting extradition. The SEC is also seeking to freeze an account registered in Hong’s mother’s name. In addition to the law firms, they also hacked other robotics companies, the U.S. said. They allegedly stole schematic designs of a robot vacuum cleaner made by a U.S. company. The three generally used the same tactics to get the information, according to the U.S. They would get the log-in credentials of an employee and place malware on a server that allowed them to access the e-mails of key people at the firms and companies, according to the indictment. In a one-day period in 2014, they took 10 gigabytes of confidential data from one law firm’s server, the U.S. said. They weren’t always successful, the U.S. said. During one six-month period in 2015, the three men allegedly tried on more than 100,000 occasions to break into the networks of five law firms. The law firms weren’t identified in the complaints. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP and Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP were among the targeted law firms. Amy Fantini, a Weil, Gotshal & Manges spokeswoman, declined to comment on the charges. Cravath Swaine & Moore didn’t respond to a request for comment. Intermune Buy The three men allegedly bought shares of Intermune based on the information gleaned from the hacked data. Though the deal didn’t close, they still made money as shares rose on media reports that the company was seeking a tie-up, the U.S. said. Intermune was ultimately purchased by Roche AG. Cravath advised Intermune on the deal. In another deal, the group allegedly bought shares in chipmaker Altera Corp. after Intel had retained one of the law firms to advise on an acquisition. They scored $1.4 million in profits on the trade amid media reports of the pending deal, and sold their shares before it was publicly announced, according to the indictment. Weil Gotshal was one of the law firms advising Intel on the deal. Using information gleaned from a second law firm, the trio also bought shares of Borderfree, an online commerce site that was an acquisition target of Pitney Bowes, the U.S. said. They made a profit of $841,000 on the trades after the deal was announced on May 18, 2015, according to the indictment. Prior to the Borderfree takeover, Hong and Chin bought so much of the company’s stock that on certain days the two accounted for 25 percent or more of the company’s trading volume, according to the SEC complaint.

"Following" : "Follow"}} December 27, 2016 12:03pm   Comments Share: Related PSI Chewing On Chips: Looking For Semiconductor ETFs To Rebound In 2016 Ahead of Intel Earnings, S&P Looks at Chip ETFs AMD's Insiders Unloaded $20M Worth Of Shares (Seeking Alpha) It has been a good year for the technology sector, the largest sector allocation in the S&P 500. The tech-heavy NASDAQ-100 Index is up 8.7 percent while the Technology SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLK), the largest technology exchange-traded fund, is higher by 16.5 percent. PSI, Ahead Of The Rest Semiconductor stocks have been big contributors toward the tech sector's upside this year, and that explains why the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (ETF) (NYSE: PSI) is 2016's best-performing non-leveraged tech ETF with a gain of 46.4 percent. PSI, which holds 30 stocks, is a smart or strategic beta ETF because its underlying index “is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including: price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value,” according to PowerShares.  Robust mergers and acquisitions activity has been a significant theme for semiconductor stocks and ETFs like PSI. As of early November, there had been about 20 chip deals this year worth more than $60 billion combined. Holdings And Weight While PSI does hold shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and other chip giants such as Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ: TXN), the ETF devotes 43 of its weight to large-cap stocks, which has proven to be an advantage at a time when smaller and mid-cap semiconductor names have been delivering some of the sector's best returns. Over 22 percent of PSI's holdings are mid-cap chip makers and about 35 percent are small-cap names. However, PSI's exposure to smaller growth stocks does not drag the ETF's valuation to concerning levels. For example, PSI sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.46 and a price-to-book ratio of 3.2. The comparable numbers on the NASDAQ-100 are 21.18 and 4.36. Semiconductor Space Benzinga recently reported: Semiconductor companies largely announced a slight earnings beat for Q3 and projected in-line guidance following a string of disappointing growth outlooks, while Q4 seems to be tracking modestly ahead of expectations, Bluefin’s Paul Peterson said in a report.

(IBM) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons 7 Beaten-Down Tech Stocks to Buy With 50% Upside in 2017 View All Posts As should be no surprise, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) had another eventful year. Source: Mike Lau via Flickr (Modified) The company dealt with production issues with the Model X as demand surged. Then there was the mega acquisition of SolarCity, as well as the announcement of nearly 400,000 advance deposits for the Model 3. Now, fresh off of the holiday season, traders are bidding Tesla stock up on a deal with Panasonic Corporation (ADR) (OTCMKTS:PCRFY) to drop more than 30 billion yen (about $256 million USD) on a Tesla production facility to make photovoltaic cells and modules. Today’s 3%-plus move exemplifies the broader theme — TSLA stock is erratic. In 2016, Tesla had a range of $144 to $265 — with the year-to-date loss coming to 8%. That’s disappointing considering the markets have ended the year on a very bullish note. It’s important to keep in mind, however, that Tesla stock has had a long run of strong gains. During the past five years, compound annual growth hit a staggering 50%. 10 Best Stocks for Retirement Investors So what kind of opportunity are we looking at with Tesla stock? Well, to see, let’s consider three pros and cons on Tesla stock. TSLA Stock Pros Innovation: Tesla Motors has made major breakthroughs in battery technologies (allowing for drives of over 300 miles on a single charge), electric powertrains and software systems. Yet the company has also been innovative with its business model, such as having online purchases of vehicles as well company-owned showrooms and service centers. The result is that Tesla has direct connections with its customers and better control on quality service. Interestingly enough, a Tesla car is kind of like an app. That is, there are periodic updates to the systems with “over-the-air” transmissions. This has definitely been key with the Autopilot technology, which allows for semi-autonomous driver assistance. So is it any wonder that Forbes currently ranks Tesla as the world’s most innovative company? Not really. Megatrend: The auto industry is in the midst of major technology changes. Companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have made big investments and acquisitions in the category. Of course, the main focus is on autonomous driving. According to research from Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY), the market could hit $15 billion within the next few years. All this is certainly good news for holders of TSLA stock. The company has been investing in new-fangled auto technologies since 2003. What’s more, the Autopilot hardware has logged over 1.3 billion miles so far. In other words, Tesla has a major advantage in terms of data and analytics. But the growth is likely to ramp for some time. For the second half of 2016, TSLA expects to ship 50,000 cars, which is roughly the same amount for all of last year. The Elon Factor: At 45, Musk is already a legend of the tech industry. Besides Tesla, he has launched other breakout companies, such as Zip2, Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL), SolarCity and SpaceX. Along the way, Musk has made billions for shareholders. Unlike many in Silicon Valley, though, he is not only technically super smart but has incredible marketing chops.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Report: Early Ryzen benchmarks show promise by Zak Killian  9:08 AM on December 27, 2016 The AMD-provided benchmarks for the company's upcoming Ryzen CPUs have painted the chips in a very favorable light indeed. Wiser heads know to wait for third-party data before making any judgements, though. As it turns out, some of that data is already trickling out. A reddit user posted what is reportedly a leaked image taken from the newest issue of French tech magazine Canard PC, presenting benchmarks of what appears to be a Ryzen engineering sample. I'll cut to the chase: in synthetic and productivity benchmarks like video encoding, 3D rendering, and CAD, the Ryzen sample sits comfortably between the 6-core Core i7-6800K and the 8-core i7-6900K. Meanwhile, in gaming benchmarks, the Ryzen sample sits between the Core i5-6500 and Core i5-6600 CPUs. All in all, not a bad showing for an engineering sample of AMD's new chip. The performance of this chip is impressive considering that Canard PC says its sample runs at a base clock of 3.15 GHz and a turbo speed of 3.3 GHz. That's significantly below the 3.4 GHz base clock that AMD promised in a recent presentation. While Canard PC doesn't state it outright, the low clock rate likely stems from the fact that the CPU in question is an engineering sample. Higher clock speeds on the final parts might enable Summit Ridge to catch up with Intel's faster Skylake parts in gaming benchmarks. Another notable fact is that the Ryzen CPU reportedly drew about 90W under load, after accounting for losses in the motherboard's voltage regulators. That puts the engineering sample that Canard PC tested smack into the same efficiency range as the Core i7-6900K, a CPU that drew a bit more power in exchange for more performance. Going by these numbers, it looks like Ryzen might be the leap forward that AMD needs to become a contender in the high-end CPU market again. Not only does this chip appear to hold its own against the blue team's competition, it utterly annihilates the four-year-old Piledriver-based FX-8370 processor in both performance and efficiency. Of course, given that these are unverified benchmarks of an engineering sample for an unreleased processor, keep the salt shaker handy. In any case, we're eager to get our hands on one of the new chips to put it through its paces.

Toshiba OCZ RD400 NVMe SSD Benchmarks On Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Storage on 27 December 2016. Page 1 of 4. 1 Comment While the Samsung 960 EVO NVMe SSD was promising at first, after its quick failure I decided to try out the Toshiba/OCZ RD400 NVMe M.2 SSD. For the 256GB model (RVD400-M22280-256G) this high-performance solid-state drive will set you back just $149 USD. For the latest fun NVMe SSD Linux benchmarking on Phoronix is the RD400 256GB (RVD400-M22280-256G) drive. This 256GB drive is rated for sequential reads up to 2600MB/s, sequential writes up to 1150MB/s, random reads up to 210k IOPS, and random writes up to 140k IOPS. The TBW rating is 148 TB and the daily usage guideline puts it at 81 GB/day. The RD400 drive makes use of MLC flash memory. Toshiba/OCZ does advertise the RD400 series as supported by Linux. There's rarely drive compatibility issues these days with Linux, but great to see them mention Linux support. They specifically list as supported: Linux, Fedora 21, Mint 17.1, ElementaryOS Freya, OpenSUSE 13.2, Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 14.10. For comparing the Toshiba RD400 performance under Ubuntu Linux, I compared its performance to the following NVMe M.2 devices: Intel 600p 256GB, Samsung 950 PRO 256GB, and Samsung 960 EVO 256GB. SATA 3.0 SSDs tossed into the mix were the Samsung 850 EVO 120GB, VisionTek 240GB, Toshiba TR150 120GB, and PNY CS1211 120GB. All tests were done on the same Ubuntu 16.04 system with the Linux 4.9 kernel and each SSD formatted to EXT4. All of the benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Avoid Washed Out Colors When Using HDMI on Your PC Black colors may look washed out and gray if you connect your PC to its display via an HDMI cable, and it’s not your display’s fault. This is due to the way your graphics card is converting data to colors, and there’s an easy fix. RGB Full vs. RGB Limited PCs, TVs, and other devices represent colors using a range of numbers. “RGB Full” represents colors using values from 0 to 255. 0 is the blackest black, and 255 is the whitest white. “RGB Limited” represents colors using values from 16 to 235. 16 is the blackest black and 235 is the whitest white. TV shows and movies use RGB Limited. PCs and PC games use RGB Full. If you have your PC set to output content in RGB Limited format, colors on your PC will look more washed out. Your graphics card will send 16 for the blackest black, but your monitor will show it as grey, expecting 0 for the blackest black. In other words, they’re mismatched. RELATED ARTICLE What’s the Difference Between HDMI and DVI? Which is Better? If you connect your computer to its display via HDMI, your graphics drivers may select RGB Limited if they suspect you may have connected your PC to a TV. That’s why this problem only seems to occur when you use an HDMI connection, although some people do report it happens on DisplayPort connections. If you connect your PC to a display using DVI, your drivers should automatically choose RGB Full. That’s just a quick summary of this complicated topic. For more information about the difference between RGB Full and RGB Limited, read this article. Long story short: Unless you’re watching movies on a home theater PC, you’ll almost always want your computer to output color in full RGB. Your driver should automatically select RGB Full for PC displays, but this doesn’t always happen. But you can change it manually. How to Switch to RGB Full on NVIDIA Graphics If you have NVIDIA graphics hardware, right-click your desktop background and select “NVIDIA Control Panel” to open the NVIDIA Control Panel. Select Display > Change Resolution, click the “Output Dynamic Range” box, and select “Full”. How to Switch to RGB Full on AMD Graphics If you have AMD graphics hardware, right-click your desktop background and select the “AMD Radeon Settings” option to open the AMD Radeon Settings control panel. Select Display &gt; Preferences &gt; Pixel Format, click the “Color Pixel Format” box, and select “RGB 4:4:4 Pixel Format PC Standard (Full RGB)”. How to Switch to RGB Full on Intel Graphics If you have Intel graphics hardware, right-click your desktop background and select “Graphics Properties” to open the Intel Graphics Control Panel. Select Display > General Settings > Advanced and click “Full Range” under Quantization Range. Some people report that this setting is reset to RGB Limited after they upgrade their graphics drivers. If your system was set to RGB Limited and you set it to RGB Full, an update may revert the setting to RGB Limited in the future. Keep an eye on it. There’s also a separate setting for each display you have connected to your computer, so you may need to change it multiple times if you have multiple displays. Just select the display you want to configure in your graphics driver’s control panel and then change the display to RGB Full. Remember, you want your PC’s output to match your displays. All computer monitors should be set to full RGB by default, so you want your PC to output in full RGB. If you’re connected to a TV, you’ll need to see whether your TV uses full or limited RGB. If you can, set both your PC and your TV to full RGB. If you can’t, set them both to limited. The two must “agree” if you want correct colors. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (7 REPLIES) December 27, 2016 amy acker New card, new cable, almost year old monitor, tried googling everything I could think of and I've been into every graphics utility I can find. But this really fix my issue now. December 27, 2016 Joe And all this time I thought I just had a crappy TV. Now it's like night and day after applying this fix. Thanks for bringing attention to the issue. December 27, 2016 I have Intel Graphics on Win7. My Graphics Properties dialog looks nothing like the one in the article, and there's no quantization range setting at all. Any suggestions? Here's my dialog. GraphicProperties.JPG767x711 57.4 KB December 28, 2016 Tom Wilson Did you look in the Monitor/TV settings tab? It might have another name, like "dynamic range." You could also look for something like "YPrPb" or "RGB". It's also possible that your Intel IGP may simply not have an option to force the extended dynamic range. I don't have a setting for that on my MSI Probox, for example. The good news is that my ProBox defaults to RGB mode and full dynamic range, so it's not an issue for me. December 28, 2016 Constantin Prigoreanu thanks for this great discussion about a " little" setting that , for me , made a huge difference. December 28, 2016 Thanks @wilsontp. There is a checkbox marked YPrPb. The sparse help text says it's recommended for digital displays. I don't notice any difference, but I left it checked. I guess it's not that important. December 28, 2016 Tom Wilson You might not notice much difference, depending on the display. The real difference is that older monitors, especially DVI monitors, might not recognize YPrPb and require RGB mode. To make a long story short, YPrPb is also known as "component" video. It carries the same basic content as RGB, but rather than sending red, green, and blue as separate color values, YPrPb encodes brightness, or luma (Y). The Pb component carries the difference between Luma and blue, and the Pr carries the difference between Luma and red. Green is the "leftovers." This all comes from the legacy of television transmission, where the color information is added to the signal using phase modulation. Basically, the magnitude of a pixel determines the brightness, and its timing determines the color. Finally, the "washed out" problem that happens on HDMI displays is probably due to the fact that television supports something known as "blacker than black." This also comes from the analog TV days; essentially black on NSTC video is a slightly higher voltage than "blank", and this translates as a dark gray on RGB sets. I don't actually know the purpose of this, and the interesting part is that not all NTSC variants use this. Japan, for example, sets black as 0v, the same as the blanking level. So plugging a console, video player, or computer into a Japanese TV will probably have the same ugly results as on a computer monitor. Short version, component video is used in television transmission and pretty much all digital video standards meant for video. RGB is used in computer imaging and virtually all display standards used by computer systems. It wasn't until HDMI came out that we had an interconnect and signalling standard that actually worked for both televisions and computer displays without requiring complex conversion hardware, aka "PC to TV" boxes. Really short version.. use "RGB" if you got it. (Uncheck YPbPr) Got Feedback? Click Here to Join the Discussion Tweet Chris Hoffman is a technology writer and all-around computer geek.

Jon Fingas, @jonfingas 12.27.16 in Personal Computing Comments 677 Shares Share Tweet Share Save ASUS' Chrome OS efforts are currently headlined by the cheap-and-cheerful Chromebook Flip, which mainly stands out for combination of a 2-in-1 design with a bargain basement price. However, the PC maker is about to shake things up in a big way. In the culmination of a series of leaks, Newegg has listed a $499 C302CA laptop that appears to be an upscale sibling to (but not replacement for) the Flip. It touts a larger 12.5-inch, 1080p screen, and it's running Intel's Core m3 processor instead of the budget Rockchip part you saw in the Flip last year. Combine that with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and it's clear that this is a premium Google-powered system -- not at the level of the Chromebook Pixel or HP Chromebook 13, but much nicer than the Celeron-based portables that dominate the Chrome OS world. Accordingly, the C302CA carries a more refined version of the Flip's all-metal design that includes two USB-C ports and a microSD card reader. It's much heavier than the Flip at just under 2.7 pounds, but you might not mind as much given the larger display and 0.5-inch thickness. Newegg shows the system in stock as we write this, so you might get to buy one before it's even announced. You might want to hold off until CES in early January, though. There's a real chance that ASUS will formally unveil the C302CA at the trade show, and it's likely to confirm specs as well as the possibility of different configurations. You'll have a better idea of what you're buying.

The software is free to download and released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The application allows users to rapidly convert video files from one format to another and is one of the most capable open source transcoders around. Handbrake is cross platform and works on Mac, Windows and Linux computers. The new update adds significant capabilities and is accompanied by a simpler to understand documentation, which is only available in English as of now. Existing users are advised to finish all tasks in a queue before upgrading. There are new general use presets tweaked for broader compatibility. The device presets have also been updated to include target video format for more common and newer devices. The older presets are still available in the Legacy section. There is now support for Ultra HD and 4K videos, with more frame rate options. The software takes advantage of the features in newer Intel CPUs. Audio support for FLAC, TrueHD and E-AC-3 have been added. It is now possible to export a queue from the command line interface and import the queue from a graphical user interface. There are a number of performance enhancements and bug fixes. The software can be used to convert videos from one format to another, add subtitles, add chapter markers and allows resizing of videos. Handbrake cannot be used to edit videos, combine several videos together, split a video into multiple videos or use the software to write to discs. The transcoder does not have the capabilities of bypassing DRM measures on multimedia files and is meant to be used for original content only.

Home > News By Company > ReportsWeb.com Tweet   Global Digital storage device Market by Product & Data Validation, Analysis and Forecast 2022 ReportsWeb.com published Digital storage device Market from its database. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. (EMAILWIRE.COM, December 27, 2016 ) According to Publisher, the Global Digital storage device Market is estimated at $1.64 billion in 2015 and is poised to reach $6.27 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 21.0%. The arrival of cloud computing has given rise to trends such as enterprise mobility, Big Data and analytics, which have created progressively more linked data ecosystems, and this is driving the demand for digital data storage capacity. Whereas, producing enough storage devices to hold the rapidly increasing rate is the major challenge posed by the market. The cloud has been regarded as a threat to digital storage devices market, but infact the increasing rates of cloud adoption will amplify the demand for the hard drives and solid state drives that comprise cloud storage, creating more opportunities for storage vendors. The Solid State Drive (SSD) market has seen a barb in growth, but Hard Disk Drives (HDD) sustains their dominance in the market. Technological advancements in both magnetic disks and heads will continue to aid enhancements in HDD recording. However, the come up of USB 3.0 specification for high-speed file transfer is anticipated to fuel the demand for USB flash drives in the coming years. Europe commanded the market globally. APAC is expected to emerge as the fastest growing region supported by spiralling use of entertainment services, strong economic growth and rapidly increasing SMBs in India and China.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 27, 2016December 27, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Agra Joins Chengdu's Circle of Friends to Forge a Better Tomorrow Together CHENGDU, China, Dec. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — In 2013, the Indian city of Bangalore and the Chinese city of Chengdu signed the Chengdu–Bangalore, India, Sister Cities Relations Establishment Agreement, becoming the first pair of sister cities between China and India. After Bangalore, the Indian city of Agra will also join the circle of friends of this charming Chinese city. On the 22nd of December, Agra and Chengdu signed the Agreement for the Establishment of Friendly Cooperation Relations between Chengdu and Agra, indicating the formal establishment of cooperation relations between the two sides. Chengdu is the provincial capital of Sichuan, and Sichuan Province is China’s largest regional economic entity closest to India. As early as 2,000 years ago, the Southern Silk Road, which originates from Chengdu, facilitated the delivery of Chengdu’s silk, salt and tea leaves to India. It can be summed up that Chengdu and India have always been tightly intertwined in many aspects such as economy and culture. July this year, Chengdu announced its plan for the establishment of a “world famous software city”. According to this arrangement, Chengdu will reference the development of the Indian software industry as blueprint, and make coordinated progress with Bangalore in forging the international software industry’s “dynamic duo of the east”. The India-China (Chengdu) International Yoga Festival has already been held to fantastic fanfare for two consecutive sessions since last year, attracting the participation of yoga practitioners and enthusiasts from around the globe. Practicing yoga after getting off of work has already become a trend in Chengdu. In May 2015, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi visited China and the two countries released the Joint Statement between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of India, officially announcing the establishment of a consulate-general of India in Chengdu. The Indian consulate-general is the fourth of its kind in China after Hong Kong, Shanghai and Guangzhou, and currently site selection is underway. Following the in-depth implementation of full-region opening-up, 16 countries have already obtained the approval for diplomatic missions in Chengdu. At present, the number of Chengdu sister cities has risen to 32, and that of friendship cooperation cities increased to 39. The continual expansion of the “circle of friends” brought about the enlargement of the “circle of fortune”. In recent years, Chengdu’s international “circle of fortune” continued to develop. 278 companies of Fortune Global 500 fame have already set up their presence in Chengdu, of which 199 are foreign corporations, while Chengdu also hosts a total of 6,650 foreign-funded enterprises. Intel, FAW-Volkswagen, Siemens are all some of the world’s most recognized brands that happened to raise their investments in Chengdu at the same time. In the list of the “World’s Fastest-Growing Cities in the Next Decade” published by Forbes magazine, Chengdu was listed on the top spot. Chengdu, this extra large city in western China, at present is fully committed to positioning itself as the economic center, science and technology center, cultural innovation center, foreign communication center and comprehensive transportation hub of western China. Under the opportunity of its establishment as a National Central City, Chengdu will leverage on its sound infrastructure facilities and massive development potentials to partner with various friendship cooperation and sister cities in more sectors and at higher levels, so as to jointly generate mutual benefits and create a better tomorrow.

Not a huge deal, of course. I just wonder why this is a thing. Love Handbrake, but don't use it as often these days as I'm no longer buying and ripping my own DVDs or BluRays to my media server.

For the rest of us we weren't really looking at the fact that it's V0.9 as being remotely significant and we've been using it anyway. Alpha, Beta, Early Access, these terms are all pretty useless now. V1.0 used to mean it's out of beta, QAed and ready for release as a working product. We see game titles that need patches on day 0. These labels don't work anymore. A version number is a monotonically increasing number. The only thing significant is that it goes up and only up. There's nothing significant about V1.0. We should just use Linux epoch time for version numbers.

Twitter Facebook The Ethernet ecosystem today is driven by applications, not speed alone Diverse applications in new and traditional industry verticals expand the Ethernet family By David Chalupsky, Director, Ethernet Alliance Board of Directors, Principal Engineer, Intel (Network World) 21 December, 2016 09:07 - - - - print email Comments For many years, Ethernet evolution was characterized by the “need for speed” as networks and data centers sought higher and higher throughput. But over time, Ethernet has found its way into applications unforeseen by the developers of the original specification, resulting in a broad and varied Ethernet ecosystem. Today the desire to bring the advantages of Ethernet into new applications necessitates a new approach where the needs of the application are considered first and foremost in defining new Ethernet incarnations. In this new paradigm, the Ethernet roadmap combines new and existing data rates with other attributes to meet various applications’ requirements. Considerations can include distance, environmental factors, acquisition vs. operational cost, longevity vs. fast time to market, ease of use and flexibility, physical infrastructure reuse and even the size and weight of the cabling. In use cases ranging from industrial processes to security to connected cars, Ethernet is increasingly enabling your lifestyle, safety and productivity. New Ethernet applications Two new Ethernet specifications illustrate the application-driven approach for the automotive environment, which requires lightweight cabling and robustness in the face of harsh environmental conditions. The IEEE 802.3bw-2015 100BASE-T1 and IEEE 802.3bp-2016 1000BASE-T1 standards provide 100 Mb/s and 1000 Mb/s Ethernet over a single twisted pair copper cable in the “connected car” and mark the entry of Ethernet into vehicular applications to connect the growing number of intelligent devices found there.  As the number of connected devices in a vehicle design increases, the more valuable it becomes to provide the automotive industry with an in-vehicle, homogenous network architecture, and Ethernet serves that purpose very well. Enthusiasm appears to be high in this area, as industry discussion is already addressing the topic of “what’s next?” for automotive Ethernet. Don’t be surprised, but the answer may be to go both faster and slower. The most cost and power sensitive devices, without a lot of data to move, may benefit from a single-pair 10 Mb/s specification. On the other hand, connecting sensors and compute resources for autonomous, self-driving vehicles will cause the bandwidth needs to surge well past 1 Gb/s, and Ethernet may be put to work once again to fill this need. Extending this idea even further, the IEEE 802.3 10 Mb/s Single Twisted Pair Ethernet Study Group is focused on bringing Ethernet protocol with lower costs and longer reaches to industrial automation, building automation and automotive applications. Although we primarily consider Ethernet to be a data network protocol, consider Ethernet’s utility in moving electric power along the same copper cable as the network data, referred to as Power over Ethernet (PoE). PoE has long been used as a means to power wireless access points, security cameras and IP telephones. Now, new PoE specifications are in the works to provide higher power and more efficient PoE on 4-pair cabling, as well as providing PoE over the single pair cabling used by 100/1000BASE-T1. Currently, 4-Pair PoE is being standardized by the IEEE P802.3bt task force to deliver power over all 4 twisted pairs, versus the two pairs in current PoE and PoE+ technology. On one hand, this higher power PoE capability will enable higher bandwidth applications, such as higher speed wireless access points. On the flip side, this capability can also be used where little data transmission is needed, such as intelligent lighting systems. To complement 100BASE-T1 and 1000BASE-T1 networks, IEEE P802.3bu is specifying power delivery over the same single pair cable used for data for applications in internal automotive networks. The goal here is reducing the weight and cost of wiring harnesses – one of the heaviest items in an automotive bill of materials. New applications in traditional markets As Ethernet has progressed into new application areas, the existing infrastructure needs of enterprise campus applications have also driven a choice of speed. Serving this need, IEEE Std 802.3bz-2016 defines 2.5 Gb/s and 5 Gb/s MAC operating speeds, and 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T PHYs operating over category 5e, category 6, or better cabling. The technology is already in products where it allows users to realize greater data bandwidth from the 70+ billion meters of installed cabling while also supporting PoE for our beloved wireless access points. What’s next in this whirlwind of new Ethernet applications and corresponding standards? This most versatile and adaptable protocol continues to evolve. Don’t worry – the need for speed is still there, and development is underway to specify Ethernet links at 50/100/200/400Gbps, from a few inches to tens of kilometers in reach. This is where the network adrenaline junkies thrive, putting to work the latest in electrical and optical signaling technologies in that robust and cost effective form that we call Ethernet. Undoubtedly, the diverse, even currently unimagined networking needs of the Internet of Things (IoT) will drive new Ethernet applications as well. A standard that began life over 30 years ago to connect computers to printers at 10 Mb/s continues to evolve to serve myriad new applications, with no end in sight.

Companies using Privacy Shield worry that it may face the same fate as long-used predecessor the Safe Harbor Framework, which was overturned by the European Court of Justice in October 2015 after revelations of mass surveillance by the U.S National Security Agency.  Digital Rights Ireland and French civil liberties group La Quadrature du Net have also challenged Privacy Shield in court, saying the new framework doesn't adequately protect Europeans' privacy. While U.S. companies are embracing Privacy Shield, many European businesses are "still concerned that Privacy Shield will not hold up under court scrutiny, and they will find themselves in the same scenario as they were in October 2015, when the Safe Harbor agreement was struck down," said Deema Frei, global privacy officer at Intralinks, a New York cloud-based content collaboration provider. Some European companies see Privacy Shield certification as a "tick box" compliance exercise, she added. With some doubts about its long-term viability, companies should also consider other data transfer agreements, such as EU model clauses or binding corporate rules, she recommended. However, if companies can get certainty about Privacy Shield's future, and if it won't be "attacked in the long term by data privacy activists trying to discredit it and challenge its validity, I believe it will work in the long run," Frei added.  More than 1,100 users As of early December, about five months after Privacy Shield went into effect, about 1,150 U.S. companies had signed up to handle European customer data under Privacy Shield, up from about 500 at the end of September. Another 600 U.S. companies had applications under review. Those numbers compare to more than 4,500 U.S. companies that had participated in the Safe Harbor data-transfer program, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Like Intralinks, cloud security firm CipherCloud is worried about the legal challenges to Privacy Shield, said David Berman, senior product marketing manager there. "If a European Court decision does invalidate Privacy Shield, there will be another period of uncertainty" similar to what happened after the Safe Harbor agreement was struck down, he said. "If the new framework can withstand legal challenges it should continue to attract companies that want an overarching mechanism to transfer EU data to the U.S." Small and medium-size businesses, as well as cloud providers, seem to be embracing Privacy Shield, but the new data transfer rules impose more obligations than the old agreement, Berman said.  "Privacy Shield has more privacy protections for individuals than Safe Harbor, so firms will have to be more diligent and ensure they are complying with the new privacy principles or risk public disclosure of a violation by the U.S. Department of Commerce," he said. "Some firms may find the increased oversight, additional requirements, and sanctions for non-compliance under Privacy Shield a barrier to adoption." Compliance and surveillance With the number of Privacy Shield companies still lagging behind those that used Safe Harbor, this could indicate that Privacy Shield is more difficult to comply with, added Elodie Dowling, corporate vice president and general counsel for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at BMC Software. In addition to the legal challenges, some EU data privacy regulators have suggested that Privacy Shield "does not do enough to curtail U.S. surveillance," Dowling added. EU privacy regulators will review the agreement in 2017. The legal challenges may be only beginning, she added. Max Schrems, the Austrian man who led the fight against Safe Harbor, has questioned how 500 companies received certification in the first month Privacy Shield was available. "This is undoubtedly showing that there are serious concerns around ... Privacy Shield and its ability to indeed protect EU citizen’s fundamental right of privacy when their personal data is being transferred to the U.S.," Dowling said. BMC has not yet signed up for Privacy Shield, instead deciding to "rely on another mechanism to safely and legally transfer personal data outside of the EU anywhere in the world" -- through binding corporate rules. For Privacy Shield to succeed, it needs support from the EU, including the data protection authorities in each member state, added David Hoffman, Intel's associate general counsel and global privacy officer. Intel supports the new agreement but wants to keep other mechanisms, such as binding corporate rules, in place as well, he said. If data transfers are between subsidiaries of the same company, companies can use binding corporate rules to define the data responsibilities. As an alternative to Privacy Shield, companies can protect external transfers through model contract clauses restricting what the receiving company may do with the data.  But companies are concerned about the future of those alternate data transfer methods as well, Hoffman said. While Privacy Shield and alternative transfer methods are in place for now, the future is uncertain. "Some of the same arguments about Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield can be made about alternative transfer methods," he said. "If there are concerns about law enforcement and national security agencies accessing information, then there would be the same concerns about alternative methods because those agencies can also access it when it's transferred by other means." 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Twitter Facebook Tech companies like Privacy Shield but worry about legal challenges The future of data transfers between the EU and US is uncertain, companies say Grant Gross (IDG News Service) 21 December, 2016 22:00 - - - - print email Comments Privacy Shield, the new international framework allowing companies to transfer customer data between the EU and the U.S., is getting good reviews so far, but some companies aren't betting on it for the long term. Companies using Privacy Shield worry that it may face the same fate as long-used predecessor the Safe Harbor Framework, which was overturned by the European Court of Justice in October 2015 after revelations of mass surveillance by the U.S National Security Agency.  Digital Rights Ireland and French civil liberties group La Quadrature du Net have also challenged Privacy Shield in court, saying the new framework doesn't adequately protect Europeans' privacy. While U.S. companies are embracing Privacy Shield, many European businesses are "still concerned that Privacy Shield will not hold up under court scrutiny, and they will find themselves in the same scenario as they were in October 2015, when the Safe Harbor agreement was struck down," said Deema Frei, global privacy officer at Intralinks, a New York cloud-based content collaboration provider. Some European companies see Privacy Shield certification as a "tick box" compliance exercise, she added. With some doubts about its long-term viability, companies should also consider other data transfer agreements, such as EU model clauses or binding corporate rules, she recommended. However, if companies can get certainty about Privacy Shield's future, and if it won't be "attacked in the long term by data privacy activists trying to discredit it and challenge its validity, I believe it will work in the long run," Frei added.  More than 1,100 users As of early December, about five months after Privacy Shield went into effect, about 1,150 U.S. companies had signed up to handle European customer data under Privacy Shield, up from about 500 at the end of September. Another 600 U.S. companies had applications under review. Those numbers compare to more than 4,500 U.S. companies that had participated in the Safe Harbor data-transfer program, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Like Intralinks, cloud security firm CipherCloud is worried about the legal challenges to Privacy Shield, said David Berman, senior product marketing manager there. "If a European Court decision does invalidate Privacy Shield, there will be another period of uncertainty" similar to what happened after the Safe Harbor agreement was struck down, he said. "If the new framework can withstand legal challenges it should continue to attract companies that want an overarching mechanism to transfer EU data to the U.S." Small and medium-size businesses, as well as cloud providers, seem to be embracing Privacy Shield, but the new data transfer rules impose more obligations than the old agreement, Berman said.  "Privacy Shield has more privacy protections for individuals than Safe Harbor, so firms will have to be more diligent and ensure they are complying with the new privacy principles or risk public disclosure of a violation by the U.S. Department of Commerce," he said. "Some firms may find the increased oversight, additional requirements, and sanctions for non-compliance under Privacy Shield a barrier to adoption." Compliance and surveillance With the number of Privacy Shield companies still lagging behind those that used Safe Harbor, this could indicate that Privacy Shield is more difficult to comply with, added Elodie Dowling, corporate vice president and general counsel for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa at BMC Software. In addition to the legal challenges, some EU data privacy regulators have suggested that Privacy Shield "does not do enough to curtail U.S. surveillance," Dowling added. EU privacy regulators will review the agreement in 2017. The legal challenges may be only beginning, she added. Max Schrems, the Austrian man who led the fight against Safe Harbor, has questioned how 500 companies received certification in the first month Privacy Shield was available. "This is undoubtedly showing that there are serious concerns around ... Privacy Shield and its ability to indeed protect EU citizen’s fundamental right of privacy when their personal data is being transferred to the U.S.," Dowling said. BMC has not yet signed up for Privacy Shield, instead deciding to "rely on another mechanism to safely and legally transfer personal data outside of the EU anywhere in the world" -- through binding corporate rules. For Privacy Shield to succeed, it needs support from the EU, including the data protection authorities in each member state, added David Hoffman, Intel's associate general counsel and global privacy officer. Intel supports the new agreement but wants to keep other mechanisms, such as binding corporate rules, in place as well, he said. If data transfers are between subsidiaries of the same company, companies can use binding corporate rules to define the data responsibilities. As an alternative to Privacy Shield, companies can protect external transfers through model contract clauses restricting what the receiving company may do with the data.  But companies are concerned about the future of those alternate data transfer methods as well, Hoffman said. While Privacy Shield and alternative transfer methods are in place for now, the future is uncertain. "Some of the same arguments about Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield can be made about alternative transfer methods," he said. "If there are concerns about law enforcement and national security agencies accessing information, then there would be the same concerns about alternative methods because those agencies can also access it when it's transferred by other means."

Wanted: More women CIOs (but do they want the job?) Although women account for less than 20 percent of CIOs at large enterprises, experts say new leadership opportunities are emerging as companies undertake digital transformations. Clint Boulton (CIO (US)) 21 December, 2016 02:02 - - - - print email Comments Men hold the overwhelming majority of positions in IT leadership, where women fill less than 20 percent of CIO roles at top-performing companies. The lack of diversity remains a thorny issue heading into 2017 and the numbers are unlikely to improve markedly, a painful failing for corporate boards starving for diverse C-suites. But there is a silver lining, if you can call it that: Experts say some women working for increasingly digitally focused companies are choosing leadership roles outside of IT. In an effort to bolster gender diversity in the C-suite, corporate boards are asking executive recruiters to "scour the universe" for female candidates, says Gerry McNamara, global managing director of the information officers practice at Korn/Ferry International. Korn Ferry International Gerry McNamara, Korn/Ferry International. "Most managers understand that ethnically and gender-diverse talent means diversity of thought and they want to make sure that they have a team that is thinking broadly," McNamara says. However, McNamara also says the effort is challenging because the number of male CIOs candidates is significantly higher than female candidates. [ CIO.com blogs: Diverse-IT ] The spotlight on the diversity challenge have never been brighter. In recent years, statistics released by Apple, Google, Facebook and other tech companies detailing poor workplace diversity have become a sore spot. Gender diversity issues are particularly acute in the C-suite. A Korn/Ferry analysis of top 1,000 performing companies by revenue found that women currently fill only 24 percent of prominent C-Suite titles, such as CEO, CFO, CIO and CMO. The poll also revealed that only 19 percent of CIOs are female. Diversity in tech headed the wrong way Focus that lens on the Fortune 500 and the female CIO count is even smaller. Last year, 87 of the Fortune 500 had female CIOs, or 17.4 percent, according to Sharon Gillenwater, founder and editor in chief of C-suite marketing consultancy Boardroom Insiders. As of November 1, the number dropped to 75, or just 15 percent. And while 20 percent of Fortune 100 companies have women CIOs in 2016, the number is down from 24 percent in 2015, Gillenwater says. Boardroom Insiders. Sharon Gillenwater, Boardroom Insiders. [ Related: Battling gender bias in IT ] The numbers are as overwhelming as they are unsurprising. Korn/Ferry’s McNamara says gender diversity in the C-suite, particularly for technology managers, is a systemic issue he's seen since he began his executive recruiting career at Heidrick & Struggles in 1995. One of the reasons is that IT still suffers from the perception problem: Most people still view the CIO as some guy with a computer science background who manages servers. The male-dominated culture, portrayed in television shows such as the AMC series "Halt and Catch Fire," can be unappealing to women. It needn't be this way, says McNamara, who notes that the CIO role has evolved beyond the data center to become more focused on driving business transformations and customer-facing initiatives. The digital era is characterized by on-demand services and the democratization of mobile and cloud computing. Two decades ago most corporate computers were sealed in air-conditioned rooms. Today consumers walk around with smartphones in their pockets and order products and services from the likes of Amazon.com and Uber. McNamara says that while a technical background helps, many successful CIOs today are smart, high-performing leaders who can manage complex, large-budget projects and deliver them on time. "The path for CIOs used to be development, infrastructure, architecture and over time you'd become a candidate for a CIO role," McNamara says. "But you don't need to [follow] that path anymore. There are a number of CIOs who aren't technical but are great leaders." Women’s leadership choices extending beyond IT But here's another truth: There are also a number of women for whom the CIO role is simply not as attractive as other emerging functions. The proliferation of digital transformations has given rise to several prominent, high-level positions for strong female leaders. Witness GE's Beth Comstock, who after introducing lean startup principles at the industrial manufacturer while serving as CMO, was promoted to vice chair of business innovations, where she focuses on business model transformation. And some top-performing women CIOs, including GE's Jamie Miller, Deutsche Bank's Kim Hammonds and Intel's Kim Stevenson, have been promoted to other roles within their organizations. [ Related: 4 women describe their nontraditional journeys to tech ] "Maybe the CIO role is not the ultimate choice for women who can pick and choose where they go," says Gillenwater, of Boardroom Insiders. Gartner analyst Tina Nunno says more women are moving into chief digital officer or similar roles. “It’s a highly strategic, customer-facing role, and quite a few women are gravitating to that particular role,” Nunno says. Earlier this week, Rent-A-Center CIO Angela Yochem hired Wal-Mart executive Lety Nettles as vice president of digital integration, a newly created position at the furniture company. Whether women who assume leadership roles outside of IT return to become CIOs in the future remains a question. But corporate boards are keenly interested in instituting more diversity in their C-suites because of empirical evidence that diversity tends to engender greater profitability. In February, the Peterson Institute for International Economics and EY found that companies with at least 30 percent women in leadership roles may boost their net profit margins by 15 percent compared to those with no female leaders. There is no easy path to solving the gender diversity problem, though Nunno says the greater awareness Silicon Valley companies have brought to diversity can help. For instance, she says that recent controversies about unequal pay have forced Silicon Valley companies to review and compare salaries of women and men. "This could force companies to look more objectively at how people are performing and have a much broader discussion on who they're looking at as potential leaders," Nunno says.

Dan Muse (CIO (US)) 23 December, 2016 10:04 - - - - print email Comments We write a lot about collaboration and partnerships at CIO.com. After all, it has never been more important for IT leaders to partner — whether that means working with the growing number of vendors that provide critical competencies once firmly rooted on-premises or, perhaps more importantly, partnering with CMOs and other C-level executives in departments that command their own technology budgets. While our primary role as technology journalists is to provide information to help you do your jobs better, leverage your expertise and advance your careers, we sometimes have the opportunity to practice what we preach. [ Analytics 50 winners for 2016 ] We’re proud of our partnership with Drexel University and the LeBow College of Business, and the fruits of that collaboration: the Analytics 50 awards program. This initiative, which we expect to expand in the coming years, is a blend of academia and media. A lot of partnerships look good on paper. This one certainly did, because Drexel’s Decision Sciences department and CIO.com are both committed to reporting on analytics. It’s a natural fit. But partnerships don’t thrive because they look good on paper. While logistics, criteria and deadlines are always challenges, this project evolved easily from the moment we first discussed ways we could work together. Diana Jones and Murugan Anandarajan from Drexel University not only ensured the Analytics 50’s success by bringing vision and commitment to business analytics, but they also showed an unrelenting understanding of what makes collaboration work — recognition of shared goals, patience, empathy and a sense of humor. On Nov. 9, we recognized the Analytics 50 honorees at an event in Philadelphia at Drexel University’s Gerri C. LeBow Hall, and we further highlight these inspiring business analytics projects in our feature story “Innovators Reap Results.” CIO.com Senior Writer Thor Olavsrud, our award-winning reporter of all things analytics, dives deep into five winning projects. Choosing only five of the 50 winners was challenging. But after poring over the entries, we decided on Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Intel, the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions, the Philadelphia 76ers and The North Face. As you read Olavsrud’s story, you’ll note collaboration and partnership aren’t empty words. For example, Braden Moore, the Philadelphia 76ers’ director of analytics and insights, sums up a sentiment that permeates this year’s honorees. “We didn’t necessarily have any metrics or KPIs specific to the model. Instead, we had the organizational revenue and retention targets. One of the organization’s core values is ‘Collaboration Wins.’ Therefore, it wasn’t about the success of this analytics project as much as it was a piece of the overall picture.” The Continuum from Building to Buying your infrastructure More from Dell EMC Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

After looking at the previous products the company announced, the Mi Notebook Pro should come with an aluminum body, making it highly durable as far as quality goes. Additionally, one of the biggest changes according to My Drivers is the fact that the upcoming notebook is going to come with a 4K display. 4K displays on notebooks are becoming a reality, but they carry much larger price tags, so it looks like Xiaomi is releasing quite the competitor. However, while the 4K display is attractive, it could be the primary difference standing in the way of achieving an adequate level of performance. If the 4K resolution fact comes out to the true, you’d do well to scale that down to 1080p for better performance. Other details claim that the Mi Notebook Pro is going to come with Intel’s 6th generation Skylake processor, and not just any processor, but an i7-6700HQ. For those that don’t know, this CPU is a quad-core chip running at a speed of 2.60GHz and is normally found in high-end notebooks, so we know that the company will be targeting the enthusiast crowd. It has also been detailed that the notebook will come packing with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It has not been revealed if the SSD will support the SATA interface or PCIe one, but we’ll wait for the official details to arrive to provide the update. One last thing; the Mi Notebook Pro will come with an NVIDIA GTX 960M, which is nowhere near the league of the GTX 1000 series of chips, but for a notebook that’s going to cost you less than $900, you obviously should not complain about what you’re receiving.

Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict The Vensmile K8 is all about practicality – it is a computer that’s both portable and has a usable keyboard and touchpad. Don’t expect a road warrior for this price, though. For Innovative form factor VGA adaptor Against Only two USB ports Poor performance Geekbuying sent us the Vensmile K8, an entire computer that is about the size of a standard keyboard which is foldable and costs just over £137 (around $170, AU$230) – not a bad price for what you get here. (That price is exclusive of any taxes that may be levied by HMRC or the courier companies on behalf of the vendor. Want to buy tech from online Chinese retailers? Read this first.) The K8 comes with an HDMI cable, a 15W (5V3A) adaptor and a rather elegant, leather-like, carrying pouch. Note that the device is advertised as waterproof but what this actually means is that the keyboard is spill-proof; immersing the K8 completely in water will kill it. Unfold the K8 and you’ll find a rubber keyboard with 87 keys and a small metal box on the right. The device is meant to be used as a temporary computer. There’s no indication as to how many strokes the keys are expected to last but given the very nature of the material, don’t expect them to last tens of millions of keystrokes (as is the case for most mechanical keyboards). Typing on it is not the greatest of experiences – it’s a bit hit and miss as the device only registers a keystroke when you hit the middle of the key rather than the edges – but it’s definitely better than typing on a non-responsive capacitive display. At least you have actual feedback rather than just haptic feedback. The keyboard base is about 2mm thick while the keys add another 2mm. The elevated touchpad is located on the top of the computer, and it is a tiny 85 x 12 x 120mm affair; there are three status lights (‘worked’, power and lock) just above. A raised surface is not something common on personal computers, so it takes some time to acclimatise to this. The fact that it is on the right-hand side will put off some left-handed users. It also doesn’t have any left or right click buttons which is frustrating; instead you have to double-tap with two fingers to bring up the options menu. Flip the computer over and you will see slits on the underside – to help cool the components – and four tiny rubber feet. The chassis of the PC is metallic so that should help with cooling as well. As for most of the entry-level PC devices we’ve seen recently, this one comes with the same assortment of components. There’s a quad-core system-on-a-chip, the Intel Atom x5-Z8300, which is clocked at 1.44GHz with 2MB of cache and a Gen8 GPU. It is flanked by 4GB of RAM, 64GB eMMC storage (which can be supplemented by a microSD card), 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. Surprisingly, it sports a legacy port, an antiquated VGA connector, which is great if you have old projectors or displays. There’s also an HDMI port, one USB 3.0 plus a USB 2.0 port and an earphone jack along with a retractable antenna. Switch on the computer – the power button is on the side – and the classic Windows 10 installation process kicks off with no pre-registration tricks.  However, within seconds, it asks for a product key – just going further (skip it), allowing the installation to proceed until the end and allowing the system to reboot solves that problem. Performance-wise, this is an entry-level computer so your expectations should be tempered accordingly. It is, after all, an Atom-based computer, albeit with 4GB of memory and 64GB on-board storage which should be enough for lightweight computing. Tests across five benchmark programs (see the results above) showed that the K8 ranks among the weaker devices that use this trio of hardware components, reaffirming our belief that this is more of a casual device aimed at users seeking a secondary computer for remote working. Early verdict The K8 is a tale of two halves. On the one hand, there is much to be liked about it. We appreciated the form factor and the fact that it is a complete computer that you can shove in your back pocket is great – plus you can use it on any television set without needing to cart along a keyboard and a mouse. On the other hand, the performance delivered by the K8 is one of the lowest we’ve seen on an Intel Z8300 coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage. Why it performs so poorly remains a mystery. As concerns potential improvements for a theoretical K9, swapping out the proprietary connector for a microUSB one should be on the agenda, although top of the priority list should be sorting out those performance issues.  An embedded battery would also be fabulous in case you want to type a quick email in a cybercafé without the need to hunt for a power socket. There’s also a very solid case for using the Vensmile K8 as an out-and-about thin client, especially if it is made a tad more rugged. Its ability to be used on almost any surface (even curved ones) and the fact that it has a spill-proof keyboard could be useful in certain circumstances.

In the first phase of campus recruitment last week, of the total 176 companies, 45 were start-ups, including Belcan, Citicorp Services, Enfrein, My Ally and Noodle Analytics. A total of 137 offers were made, which saw 116 students being placed. Incidentally, the total number of 45 companies in the first phase is equivalent to the number of start-ups that visited the institute during the entire academic year 2014-15, recruiting118 students. However, the number doubled in 2015-16 with a total of 95 start-ups recruiting 259 students. “We expect a similar trend this year with a significant number of students joining start-ups,” said an official at IIT. The first phase of the 2016-17 placement season at IIT Madras began on December 1 with the ‘graveyard’ session at 00:01 hrs. After a total of 14 sessions of placement interviews, which were scheduled till December 13, a total of 672 out of 1,195 registered students were placed. Along with 57 students who have accepted pre-placement offers, the total number of students placed so far stands at 729. Companies that made a large number of offers include Intel, Citicorp Services, Eaton, Samsung R&D Bangalore, EY, EXL Services, Belcan and Axis Bank. A total of nine international offers were made, including three in the ‘graveyard’ session. A total of 90 participating companies were from the R&D and core sectors. This was followed by 43 from the IT-related sector. There were also more than 35 companies in analytics and consulting, according to IIT Madras data. Interestingly, apart from Indian Navy, ISRO and ONGC that had conducted their placements before December 1, IIT Madras saw participation from Coal India, BEL, and CDAC among government-led companies during the first phase. More PSU and government-led companies are expected on the campus during the next phase, set to commence from mid-January, said a statement from the institute. Manu Santhanam, Advisor - Training & Placement, IIT Madras, in the statement said the first phase of campus placements saw almost 60 per cent of the registered students getting job offers, a situation similar to last year. “We hope the momentum continues in the next phase.” (This article was published on December 26, 2016) Related TOPICS economy, business and finance | manpower | education | universities and colleges | labour | employment | education | science and technology | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

It is the most expensive consumer offering but also the most technically advanced, offering full spatial tracking. Its rivals, namely the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR, are both excellent devices, but even with their own motion controllers, neither offer quite as immersive an experience as the Vive. There is one snag though, it needs a lot of space and patience to set up and use correctly. We encountered several key issues ourselves, causing more than a few expletives to fly, so hopefully our obstacles and the way we overcame them will help you if you come across the same problems. HTC Vive review: An experience that’s out of this world To give you context, we set-up the Vive in a normal, average living room inside a flat, with (just) enough space for the movement aspects of the Vive to work. We also used a gaming-specific tower PC recently built (by ourselves) that exceeds all of the recommended requirements. After, we also set it up on an amazing gaming laptop for good measure, to give a second side to the story. Here is what we found out... Pocket-lint HTC Vive unboxing Considering how much tech is involved, the HTC Vive kit comes in a reasonably compact box. However, lift the upper compartments and you soon find so many leads and power supplies that the whole task ahead of you seems daunting. Technically, the setup process when started on a PC takes a quoted 30 minutes, but opening the box, unsealing all the components, and laying them out in front of you so you can see what's what before you even download the setup software can take anywhere up to 15 minutes before you even switch on your computer. We recommend you do this, as you'll then get an idea of what cable goes with what device, as the package comes with the HTC Vive headset, two base station room sensors, two motion controllers, the link box you need to connect to a PC, and a pair of in-ear headphones. HTC Vive setup software The next stage is to download the software from HTCVive.com/setup. It does a good job of guiding you step by step through the process and is clear and concise. It will even download and install both HTC's Vive software and Steam if you don't already have it. It will also install SteamVR - the main software that is needed to recognise and pair all of your Vive components. If you don't have a Steam account already, the setup software will also help with that. All the HTC Vive experiences and games are available through the Steam platform, so you will need one for sure. We already have a Steam account with more than 500 games (you've got to love a Steam sale), so no trouble there. The software then dwells on each of the components, explaining how you set them up adequately. And it was with the first of these we realised our first problem. HTC Vive base station sensors The HTC Vive kit comes with two base stations, sensors that map where the headset and controllers are at any one time. They are essential to the experience and need to have clear line of sight to the entire play area. They need to be in opposite corners so that their vision overlaps for a better reading of the space and therein lies the problem. HTC provides a wallmount for each of the base stations, so you can screw them into the wall - the setup software even advises you might need a drill. We were using our Vive in a rented accommodation however, so didn't want extra holes in the walls. But as the sensors need to be above head height and angled downwards, it presented quite a problem. We didn't even have any high shelves in the room to sit them on. Pocket-lint Luckily, one answer came in the form of a tripod we use for photography, so that was one base station sorted. It just about reached above head height. The other base station would be more of a problem as we don't have two tripods laying around. The only solution we could come up with was to use the living room door, opened inwards, as a makeshift base station stand. We placed it on top of the door, facing the play area and angled downwards by shoving a USB stick under the rear (as the stations are simply cubes with no tilting mechanism of their own). Pocket-lint It's also worth remembering that each base station gently vibrates - we suspect they have optical motors inside - so you do need to fix them down even if placing them on a shelf. We used duct tape in a very inelegant solution. Worked though. Another issue we were then faced with is that while the base stations communicate to each other and your PC wirelessly, they still required power. Only the one we set-up with the tripod was anywhere near a power socket. The other required a four-way power strip to be stretched across the rear of the living room, getting in the way somewhat and looking clumsy. It also took a while to find as we don't just have spare ones lying around. They don't say that in the manual. Nevertheless, the green lights on each of the sensors lit - to show they are connected and are facing in the right direction - and that stage of the process was complete. HTC Vive wireless controllers We love the style and functionality of the wireless controllers supplied with the HTC Vive. But nowhere did it say in the setup process that you should charge them before use. Maybe you don't, as most products come with quite a bit of charge in them beforehand - enough to get you going anyway. Force of habit though had us putting them on charge as soon as we got them out of the box, so they could be fully charged by the time the setup was complete. It's not a problem, more a helpful tip this time. Pocket-lint They each come with Mini-USB to USB leads and charging adapters, so if you don't have enough USB sockets on a PC to do it, you need to find even more plug sockets. What was more of an issue is that one of the controllers, no matter how we followed the instructions, where we placed it in the room, or how many times we switched it off and on again, wouldn't pair. The other did straight from the box, so it caused more than enough agitation and Basil Fawlty style shouting at the faulty one (see what we did there?). Eventually, we pressed the Menu and System buttons together for 10-15 seconds and that surprisingly did the job. It paired immediately after. This is probably something you can find out online or in the manual, but we fluked it. Pocket-lint HTC Vive link box The next step is to connect the link box, which hooks up to your PC through HDMI and USB 3.0. However, we don't have a spare HDMI socket on our Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card. Very few graphics cards have two HDMI outputs and we use ours to connect to a 1080p monitor. There's no passthrough on the link box (unlike the forthcoming PlayStation VR) so you can't split the visuals to run to both a monitor and the headset on the device HTC supplies so we were faced with an all-new, more infuriating issue. You need the monitor on to continue the setup process, so can't just plug the link box and headset in instead. So what to do? That's when we realised the link box also has a mini-DisplayPort input and the GTX 1080 has DisplayPorts. What we didn't have to hand however, was a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable. And there's not one included in the HTC Vive box - just a HDMI cable. Aaaaarrrggghhh! Those yet to set-up their HTC Vive's and have time need to consider a couple of solutions. Either use a different video output to feed a monitor (or TV), thereby leaving the HDMI port free for the link box to connect to, or buy a mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable in advance. We had neither option available to us, so it was time to scratch our heads. We could have stopped and bought a cable from a nearby store, but that kind of lead isn't just available at Argos (we know, we checked). Also, with the setup now sprawled everywhere, we were not to be beaten. Instead, Amazon Prime Now came to the rescue. We found the required cable was available to us, for around a tenner, and bought one to be delivered within a two-hour time slot. It was, we plugged it into the link box and our graphics card, and a bit of restarting and graphics driver updating nonsense, we were fit to go again. It's also worth noting that the link box also requires power, so you'll need yet another empty power socket to hand. That's five now, counting the USB charging adapters for the controllers. HTC Vive room setup wizard and calibration Now that all the hardware was correctly set-up and paired, we needed to calibrate the software for our room dimensions. That also threw up a few issues. Even when running the room setup software on the mega gaming laptop (as we'll discuss a bit further down), we had error messages and one seemingly common fault. The software asks if you want to set up the HTC Vive for room scale or standing operation. Room scale enables you to move around and therefore presents wireframe barriers inside games and experiences so you don't bump into walls or furniture. The standing still option is best for smaller rooms without the required space (of 6.5ft by 5ft). Pocket-lint We opted to set it up for room scale as our space was almost exactly right (slightly more, but just a fraction). The software asked us to point a controller at the monitor to get an idea of overhead direction, and on the next screen asked us to calibrate the position of the floor by placing the controllers in the centre of the space and clicking an on-screen button. An on-screen button that failed to appear. An on-screen button that failed to appear during setup on both the desktop and laptop PCs. This is apparently a common issue and can be solved by clinking next, completing the rest of the setup and then going back into the SteamVR software and running the room setup process again. When run straight from the menu (that appears when you click on the SteamVR icon in your Windows 10 taskbar) you get a calibration button on the exact same page in the wizard. Many have reported that it fails to appear when run from the setup tutorial. This isn't disastrous but is confusing and likely to befuddle normal consumers who aren't already cynical about PCs and hardware installation. Thankfully, the rest of the calibration steps went without fuss. We do have a tip, however; you will be asked to trace the outline of your play area using one of the controllers. We found that the advanced option (enabled through a tick box) offered the chance to simply click in the four corners of the area and the software did the rest. It provided a more accurate reading, we found. HTC Vive tutorial game and sound Finally, we were in a position where the HTC Vive was usable. We had video running to box the headset and our desktop computer. The controllers worked and worked well, and we were in a wonderful and empty holding landscape. We were in VR, hurrah! Hang on though, where's the sound? The sound was coming from our PC speakers rather than the in-ear headphones supplied. Not once did it give us an option to change that in the setup wizard. The start of the tutorial mentioned sound, but without any options to change it. If you find yourself without sound like us, you have to explore the SteamVR software options again, where you will find the settings. Once the settings pop-up has appeared, you'll need to change the options in the audio section so that sound is fed to the headphones. Our default was just to our PC speakers, but we changed it to feed the headphones only when we were using the HTC Vive. Pocket-lint You can have it feed both headphones and speakers simultaneously, or just the speakers if you have a cool 5.1 or 7.1 system cunningly placed around the play area and want the full effect. But we opted for headphones and even decided to ditch the in-ears for a better pair of headphones as it's really tricky to get the earbuds the right way round when you've already put the Vive on your noggin. At least now we had the whole effect going on, VR visuals and surround sound. We hadn't downloaded any games or other experiences yet, so there wasn't much to do (you can download them from within the virtual world, but we'd advise you download them prior to play otherwise you'll be stood around waiting for them to install). Instead, we checked out the included tutorial. Which promptly crashed. HTC Vive PC specifications As well as have strange error messages pop up during setup, we had many crashes during gameplay. It's a weird feeling too, as it's like the world just goes blank while you're in the middle of something. Pocket-lint It could be our PC but considering we exceed the recommended spec for HTC Vive it can't be the hardware surely. We have the aforementioned Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card, Intel Core i7-4790K processor running at 4GHz and 16GB of RAM. We're running 64-bit Windows 10 but doesn't everything these days with multi-core processors the norm? Crashing wasn't something we ever expected. It's worth noting that these are still early days for the HTC Vive and much of the software is updated regularly. We also found a workaround that seemed to do the job. We downloaded the beta version of SteamVR instead of the one installed with the setup software. That didn't crash at all. It also required firmware on the controllers to be updated, so is a more advanced version of the software (although might have some flaky features we haven't encountered yet thanks to being in beta). To download and try it for yourself, head into your games section on Steam, right click SteamVR in your software list and select properties. The last tab is labelled "Betas" and in there you will find a drop down menu where you can select "beta - Steam VR Beta Update". Once selected and confirmed, it downloaded a new version of SteamVR which worked for us. If that causes you problems down the line, you can always repeat the process and reselect the "opt out" option instead. Pocket-lint HTC Vive on a gaming laptop We finally got Vive working well with our desktop PC although we also highly recommend you close all other programmes before entering the virtual world. These could have been another reason for our occasional crashes. Now it was time to check the setup process with a gaming laptop. We chose to run the HTC Vive using an Asus ROG G752VY - a powerhouse of a machine running an Intel Core i7-6820HK processor and 32GB of RAM. It has an Nvidia GeForce GTX980M GPU which, while not being quite as powerful as the 1080, makes mincemeat of anything you run through it. The laptop also, mercifully, has a HDMI output that works while simultaneously feeding video to the monitor. That potentially makes a gaming laptop a more attractive option to run Vive from, especially for those who haven't even heard of a DisplayPort. We still had issues with the room scale setup and error messages, and you'll still have all the practical quibbles with finding places to place the sensors and their power supplies, but in many ways setting up the Vive with the Asus was a smoother operation. We also didn't experience the same level of crashing when running the general SteamVR software rather than the beta build. But then, the ROG G752VY costs more than £2,000. We built our own PC for less than a grand. It does though have the added benefit of being portable. Our gaming tower PC is most certainly not. HTC Vive final thoughts Although this isn't our review of the headset or the games, (you can find that here) we still have some thoughts worth sharing. These are early days for virtual reality and we're certain that there will be future headsets that refine the process, but we found the setting up of the HTC Vive to be a partly frustrating and lengthy experience. It didn't help that we didn't have the right cable, or the right cable but the wrong output, but that's something normal consumers will face too. Every problem was solved eventually and the end result is well worth it, we feel. We're also sure that software niggles will continue to be sorted through patches and updates, and may have already since publication. But based on our own encounters, VR and the HTC Vive specifically is not quite consumer-friendly enough for our parents. Not unless we set it up for them first.

TrueOS & DragonFlyBSD Performance vs. Linux At The End Of 2016 Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 26 December 2016. Page 1 of 4. 6 Comments Last week I published various Linux workstation/server distribution OS benchmarks for ending out the year on the Linux distro comparison front (though a desktop/gaming focused comparison is coming this week) while for those curious here are some BSD operating system results compared to the Linux workstation/server performance figures. For some end-of-year BSD benchmarking were (FreeBSD 12 based) TrueOS 20161215 and DragonFlyBSD 4.6.1 tested on the same Intel Core i7 6800K + MSI C236A WORKSTATION as used for the Linux workstation/server benchmarks from a few days ago. On the same exact system, TrueOS and DragonFlyBSD were both tested out-of-the-box to compare to our numbers from Clear Linux, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 16.10, CentOS 7, openSUSE Leap 42.2, and Debian Linux 8.6 All of the tests were done with the Phoronix Test Suite but a smaller amount of the tests were BSD-compatible and thus in this article aren't as many results as last week's Linux comparison.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 27, 2016December 27, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Global Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) Market – Industry Analysis, Growth, Trends, Forecast 2016 – 2024 Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a platform used to deploy services inside the radio access network (RAN) to enhance user knowledge. It provides a capability that empowers workers to improve latency sensitive services. In other words, MEC is a platform used to bring an IT service and cloud computing environment to support content suppliers and application developers. Some of the notable characteristics of this environment includes high frequency range and ultra-low latency as well as real-time access to radio network data, which are consequently utilized by the applications.

As with the other biggest data breaches suffered throughout the year, there were several things every user should do. This, as the fallout from the somewhat-smaller massive Ashley Madison hack was quantified, with the company fined $US8.75m ($A11.6m) and submitting to 20 years of federal security auditing as well as paying a $US1.6m ($A2.1m) settlement related to the breach. Even as the recount in the US election continued – with the margin for Donald Trump up slightly – US officials were cagey about their potential response to what increasingly became recognised as cybersecurity interference from Russia in the US elections. Congressional leaders were asking questions even as US president Barack Obama promised to punish Russia for its actions and it was revealed that a group of Russian hackers had stolen login credentials from a US agency that tests and verifies voting equipment. The infiltration methods triggered reminders about how to stop being infiltrated by suspicious emails, while those concerned with Internet of Things (IoT) device security didn’t miss a chance to point out that privacy protections for wearable devices are too weak. Dozens of people were arrested in a multinational crackdown on DDoS perpetrators, while experts were offering tips to stay ahead of ransomware threats – and to understand how cybersecurity investigators are using maths to improve their identification of hackers. A coalition of security researchers fighting ransomware added 30 new members and decryption tools for dozens of ransomware variants. Yet with non-malware attacks on the rise and too many companies doing little or no security testing, building up a broader Industrial-products giant CSR explained how it had built a unified security defence in the cloud, while drone manufacturers were literally bringing better security to the cloud through an effort to issue drones with digital certificates. Facebook was also working with digital certificates, launching a tool that lets domain name owners find certificates issued without their knowledge. Speaking of things happening without users’ knowledge, Evernote changed its policy to allow employees to read customers’ notes where necessary – but quickly changed its mind after a surge of complaints. Yet its idea – to use the notes to train machine-learning algorithms – reflects a growing trend that is also pushing hackers to find new ways to get around artificial-intelligence defences. Data visibility is crucial to ensuring business continuity across the business-cloud boundary – particularly given findings of a new study that suggest nearly half of all Web sites pose security risks to visitors. Also posing security concerns were pagers, which offer a new way for businesses to be compromised by patient hackers with the right equipment.

There were warnings that Apple’s macOS file encryption can be easily bypassed, while McAfee enterprise AV for Linux was found to be suffering a number of remote-exploit bugs.

A Tour of Silicon Valley’s Leaky Pipeline What works (or doesn't work) to get more women into tech jobs?

The audio version of this story aired earlier on Latino USA; it is embedded below. Micaela Honorato is looking from the sidelines as boys from her after-school program take turns racing their handmade hovercraft on a dirt field in a city park. These remote-controlled cardboard devices are less “hover” and more “skid-along,” as the teacher Abraham Orozco puts it. Today, the middle-school kids are contending for the fastest spin around four traffic cones. Micaela is a tall 12-year-old with a serious and focused gaze. She quietly awaits her turn, then concentrates on the controls. At 16.36 seconds, she takes the lead in the competition. This after-school program is called HOLA — which stands for “Heart of Los Angeles” — and it serves the city’s Rampart District, where nearly all residents live in poverty. The vast majority of HOLA’s participants are Latino. Over nearly 30 years, the program has helped hundreds go to college. A handful of students from Orozco’s scientific arts program at HOLA have pursued successful technical careers. But Orozco says a lot of his students shy away from the tech industry, despite technical talents: They don’t want jobs with any economic risk — something quite common for work at a startup or in computer science in general. The Leak in the Pipeline It’s even harder to get girls interested. At HOLA, younger kids don’t get to choose their classes, but programs become elective for high school students. Orozco’s scientific arts program is “girl-heavy” in elementary and middle school, he says. At the high school level, only two of his 13 students are girls. And this is one of the clear leaks of the talent pipeline that feeds workers to the tech industry. Year after year, Silicon Valley companies have been criticized for their slow process in employing more women and other underrepresented groups, which for tech are black and Latino. And often, they say they simply can’t find enough qualified workers to hire. As you go through the tech talent “pipeline” to find where it leaks, HOLA illustrates a major one. Somewhere between middle school and high school graduation, girls’ interest in tech peaks and wanes. Down the line, women make up roughly half of U.S. workers and of the U.S. population — but on average represent less than a third of tech companies’ employees. For black and Hispanic workers, the numbers drop into single digits: These groups tend to comprise 3 percent or less of tech companies’ employees. And it’s not just technical fields, but all staff and leadership roles. The MySpace Gateway Attempting to reverse-engineer interest in tech, we asked women in a Slack group for Latinos in tech called Techquería: How did you first get into it? A surprising number of women replied: MySpace. The now-arcane social network allowed for a lot of customization — users could mess with the color schemes, fonts, add bells and whistles by tinkering with the source code. The site’s popularity in the mid-2000s introduced many middle- and high school girls to basic HTML. Dalia Icedo was the queen of cool MySpace designs: She got so good at customizing profiles that she created a whole separate page where other people could get her themes. “I would change the color scheme literally every day, probably,” she says, “because I was 12, I had nothing else to do.” The skills came in handy after high school, when she started an online shop to sell things like band pins and earrings — and began tinkering with visuals that bugged her, like margins that felt too wide. “So I started to just go into the code and started to see a lot of the HTML and CSS that I had learned before. And then from there I just started to pick up JavaScript,” says Icedo, who is in college and wants to become a UX (user experience) designer in Silicon Valley. “It gave me a lot more confidence of being able to pick up coding.” The Consumer/Creator Breakdown Today, social media is no less popular than 10 years ago — and girls are more avid users than boys, especially on Snapchat and Instagram. But as technology has become more user-friendly, it’s also become less customizable — even grandparents can use Facebook, but how many of us understand how it works? And talking with young girls, few are drawing the connection between using popular apps and thinking that they could program them. The number of women studying math and computer science in college peaked in the 1980s — even as overall, women receive the growing majority of bachelor’s degrees. NPR’s Planet Money podcast dug into this phenomenon, zeroing in on the year 1984: “Personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. These early personal computers weren’t much more than toys. … And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys. This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative.” Now, both the corporate marketers and the diversity activists have been trying to figure out the sensitive matter of how to market tech to girls. The line between “girly” and “for girls” can be thin. What matters is what girls can actually do with the technology, says Deldelp Medina, co-founder of Latina-focused accelerator Avion Ventures, who’s now at tech diversity nonprofit Code2040. A small pink computer isn’t terrible per se, Medina argues: Smaller keyboards are actually nice to prevent carpal tunnel in smaller hands. What’s insulting is if this computer comes with less processing power, memory or useful software than a regular one. ‘Women and everybody who’s currently underrepresented in the tech industry has to gain those skill sets, because otherwise, it will not go well for any of us.’ Deldelp Medina, on the tech-worker shortage “There’s a difference,” she says, “between wanting to celebrate your femininity and shrinking and pinking something.” The Mentorship Challenge Targeting girls with technology can get thorny. But Andrea Guendelman, creator of Latinos-in-tech social network BeVisible, says one — if not the only — thing that works is mentorship. In the summer of 2014, Jazmine Fernandez was one of the young women in the Girls Who Code program. Being raised by a single mother and sisters, Fernandez knew there’s little women can’t do. But when she heard she got placed at Facebook, Fernandez felt intimidated — excited, but mostly scared. “Because when I went, there was just a lot of …” Her voice trails off. “There was … how do I say this?” Her mentor, Raquel Vélez, steps in: “There weren’t a lot people who looked like you, huh?” Fernandez heard Vélez give a talk at Facebook headquarters, and she made a huge impression: Latinas can get jobs in Silicon Valley. “One of my favorite quotes ever is, ‘You can’t be it if you can’t see it,’ ” says Vélez, engineering manager at software company NPM. “Believe me, I have like 25 mentors, and it’s the only way I can make it through, because so often I’m the only one.” Fernandez is now studying computer science at San Francisco State University. She expects the field to always be a struggle. In one of her classes, a guy once basically tried to argue that girls can’t code. And to be Latina in tech, Vélez says you have to work four times as hard. “I like to think about it as, I walked in the back door, so that I could open the front door for everybody else.” The End of the Pipeline Where mentorship particularly comes into play is at the end of the pipeline, where underrepresented groups struggle to get hired and stay hired. Silicon Valley is a boys’ club whose networks tend to stay white, male and affluent. One company trying to break the cycle is Atipica. It has built a computer program to sift through resumes — skipping human managers to avoid hiring biases, like subconscious discrimination based on a last name or school attended. Atipica’s isn’t the only resume-reading artificial intelligence. But often, algorithms reflect the biases of humans who write them. Atipica CEO Laura Gomez says her company specifically focused on designing an unbiased AI. (Neither Gomez, nor her clients, which include Slack, agreed to discuss how well Atipica’s program works.) Chicago-based Opternative offers another example of tackling diversity head-on. It’s a startup that lets people do their own eye exams. In many ways, Opternative operates like many other startups, relying on referrals from its existing employees. Yet it’s grown into a pretty diverse group because from the get-go, its team wasn’t just white guys and it views diversity of life experiences as an asset. The Blind Spot But here’s the tricky part: While both companies get high marks for being racially diverse, gender remains a blind spot. Atipica, a Latina-run company, has one other female employee. Opternative’s technical team has women on the design side and in junior positions, but all four of its senior engineers — the leaders and decision-makers — are male. Gomez and Opternative CTO Ayo Jimoh say the women they’ve seen apply for their job openings were under-qualified. It’s effectively the pipeline argument. Jimoh’s diagnosis is that people self-select — they don’t want to pursue careers that are stacked against them, they need role models, success stories of others like them. So then, who is responsible for creating those role models? Couldn’t Jimoh or Gomez, for example, spend extra time to find a female senior engineer or promote from within? “There is a part of me that says, let me me show,” says Gomez, “but I have to put my business first and foremost.” Jimoh, too, says he has to balance that responsibility for equity with his other responsibilities “to my company, to my team, to myself, to my family.” In a way, the push for diversity in tech is still so new, it’s often treated as a cause or a mission — and fighting for a cause and running a business aren’t the same. At the end of the day, Atipica and Opternative weren’t founded to heal Silicon Valley’s diversity problem — but to fill what they see as a market need. And these are small companies — the gender balance of staff is even harder to shift at massive ships like Facebook or Google. A few companies, such as Intel and Twitter, have recently started releasing hiring goals, putting diversity in quantifiable terms. The targets aren’t lofty, but they’re specific, public — presumably someone’s measurable responsibility. The Future of the Economy And now, there’s a new challenge. As Donald Trump takes over as president of the United States, diversity advocates are worried about a push against the very concept of promoting multiculturalism. “I think we need to double-down on diversity and inclusion, quite frankly,” says Daisy Dominguez-Auger, global head of diversity at Google. “Companies are going to have to take a stronger look at what their practices are … in a much more collaborative way.” Fundamentally, the Trump administration’s economic policy is expected to focus heavily on manufacturing jobs. One of the first conversations Trump had with a tech leader after the election was a call with Apple CEO Tim Cook, in which Trump pushed for Apple to build plants in the United States. From what we know, Trump has yet to address the shortage of skilled tech workers. And many economists predict that’s a major challenge for the future of America: The economy of the future is one where almost everyone has to interact with computers and code. Diversity advocate Medina says sidelining large swaths of the population from the tech industry is no way to make sure America isn’t left behind. “We’re going to have a jobs deficit that is so huge, that if we don’t fill it, we’re going to have severe economic consequences,” she says. “Women and everybody who’s currently underrepresented in the tech industry has to gain those skill sets, because otherwise, it will not go well for any of us.” Latino USA’s Jeanne Montalvo, Noam Hassenfeld and Julia Shu contributed to this report.

The company is currently in production of its own Planet of the Apps TV show and had a small but notable presence at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. Now, notable internet entrepreneur and Mega founder Kim Dotcom is predicting that Apple will purchase a Hollywood Studio in 2017. It’s not entirely clear where Dotcom is getting his information from at this point. He made the claim in a tweet and ended it with the hashtag “#InsiderIntel,” but didn’t include any further details. Known for his hacking and espionage skills, it’s possible that Dotcom’s information is coming from inside a major studio, perhaps in a style similar to the massive Sony leak from last year. That’s purely speculation, though. Apple’s interest in the film industry has been a hot button issue in recent months. Earlier this year, it was reported that Apple had a “strong but secretive” presence at the Sundance Film Festival. The company apparently spent its time at the festival meeting with “triple A-list” talent to discuss building a lineup of original TV shows. A more recent report claimed that Apple has a “quixotic and reserved” attitude about its original content plans as it has been hesitant to go all-in. On the other hand, Apple has been working more closely with Hollywood studios to bring movies to iTunes, even while they’re still in theaters. It’s these negotiations, paired with talks with content creators like at Sundance, that lend the most credibility to Dotcom’s claim that Apple will buy a major studio in 2017. At this point, take all of this with a grain of salt. It’s unclear where Dotcom received his ‘Insider Intel’ from and he’s infamous for being at the more extreme end of the spectrum. Nevertheless, it’s fun to speculate about Apple’s interest in the movie industry, and should it actually buy a Hollywood studio, that’d be a huge move.
