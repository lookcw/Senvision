Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 29, 2016 at 4:05PM In this Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, the team discusses how Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is taking the concept of SKU rationalization to an even deeper level with "brand rationalization". Management has shed dozens of brands from the P&G portfolio in an effort to revitalize the business, and there are some key metrics investors can watch to follow the company's progress. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I wanted to make sure we got to Procter & Gamble because they have been taking, I think, this whole process and reducing and optimizing their offerings to a whole other level with the amount of brands they have dropped recently and how they're trying to refocus their resources, their money, into basically what they see as the most profitable brand portfolio that they can possibly target. Asit Sharma: Absolutely. If you take the concept of SKU rationalization and blow it up, there's a term for it. It's called brand rationalization. And that's what Procter & Gamble is up to. They also have been talking up their effort to reduce SKU count over the past several years. But a couple of years ago they woke up one day and realized, we have way too many brands in our portfolio. So, over the last 18 months, Procter & Gamble has exited, or consolidated, 61 of their brands and it's in the process of exiting 44 more by the end of this year. Again, going back to what we found in Unilever's case study, the brands that Procter & Gamble is getting rid of represented only 6% of profit during those 18 months. And when this whole process is completed, Procter & Gamble is going to be left with only 65 brands across 10 major categories. Shen: So let me hop in there really quick. One thing I wanted to make sure we touched on for listeners was also just previously, over the summer, we'd done a show that's somewhat related to this, was around inventory turnover, inventory management, and there's a point here, a metric here, for Procter & Gamble that really stands out to kind of show how this brand rationalization that you mentioned has benefited them. So let's touch on that, and then also I'd love if there are any other metrics. I know there's nothing that is one-to-one necessarily with SKU management and with reduction that investors can look at, but what other metrics can investors use when trying to evaluate a company's effort in this space? Sharma: Sure. Well, you've touched on a really great one. This is a metric that you can find on many financial websites, but if you look at days of inventory outstanding. When you hear that a big company is trying to become more efficient with its product lines, there's a way you can see if they're being effective or not. Procter & Gamble before this effort, the other day, had a days inventory outstanding of 78 days. What that means is that it takes Procter & Gamble about 78 days to cycle its inventory on average and it replaces its inventory about 78 days, if you average everything out. Through this process, P&G now has a days inventory outstanding of 58 days, and that's a very solid boost to cash flow because inventory is cash tied up. You have to build a product, you have to move it, you have to store it, to get into a store, and then you get paid and collect the cash. So this is an excellent metric to see if a company is walking the walk. And we can tell in this case that P&G is certainly walking the walk. Some other metrics you can look at include the cash conversion cycle, which, again, is maybe effective to look at but might be more difficult to find. But if you want one which is easy enough to locate, look at a company's operating cash flow. Procter & Gamble again is sacrificing some top-line sales in order to trim its brands. That means some brands will disappear; it won't be selling those on the marketplace. But if you look every quarter going forward at the amount of operating cash flow Procter & Gamble generates, if it's being successful, that number is going to grow every quarter here on out. I love to look at that when I know companies are trying to become more efficient with their resources. And these two concepts are tied together. The company cycles its inventory more quickly, it should produce more operating cash flow. And so far what we're seeing is it's a good thing that Procter & Gamble has undertaken this initiative so long-suffering investors have seen that stock for many years just remain stagnant. It's finally, I think, getting a little bit of lift from these operational efforts. Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

How Mature Are We in Engaging Customers in New Ways? CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT Oct 27, 2016 Peter Manos, Market Strategist | T&D World Magazine EMAIL Tweet Comments 1 One measure of interest is available in some cold hard numbers-- the level of revenue from electricity sales by retail power marketers. Another measure of interest is the ongoing growth in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Advertisement How mature are we, as an industry, when it comes to our efforts to engage with customers in new ways?  One measure of interest is available in some cold hard numbers-- the level of revenue from electricity sales by retail power marketers.  While the associated number of customers is still relatively low, the electric revenue of retail power marketers in the last fully reported year now exceeds of the total for municipal or cooperative utilities, per the chart below, derived from EIA data: Another measure of interest is the ongoing growth in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).  DER trends matter because they are in the process of changing our world—nothing less.  Several key needs come to the forefront: We need to elevate and share the insights and struggles of those who are actually doing real work enabling integration of DERs on the grid; We need to provide actionable analyses and views that help inform our path forward, with a reliable foundation, one that aligns the horizontal of what’s next with the vertical of our ideals; We need a foundation that stays balanced.  One as tech-savvy as it is market savvy.  One that will make as much sense from an engineering economics perspective as from a policy, customer-centric, and regulatory one. Consider this fact: More is spent annually in the U.S. on advertising 10 popular personal care brands ($1.9 billion) than what is spent by all U.S. electric utilities, combined, on advertising. Proctor & Gamble’s overall advertising budget, shown below, has been averaging between 7.7% and 8.1% of the company’s recent annual revenue, which has ranged between $89 billion and $102 billion over the last four years.   How does P&G’s spending 8% of revenue on advertising compare to electric utility rates of ad spend?  The average utility spends 20 times less! Yes. The 201 utilities reporting to FERC last year showed total electric revenue of $271 billion yet their total advertising spend was just $1 billion: We can adjust these results and create a rough estimate based on the distribution of utilities in the U.S. overall, per the recent EIA data summarized below: The 201 large utilities reporting to FERC represent 69% of total U.S. electric sales revenue.  A sampling of meeting minutes and reports from a number of munis and cooperative utility reports shows similar levels of advertisement related spending.  In addition, the same analysis for historic data from FERC between 1996 and 2013 shows little change. The muni and coop spend, along with indirect advertising through fees to national or regional organizations as well as sales and customer related expenses that may indirectly involve some goodwill being created, could perhaps double or even quadruple these figures, but even if we made these figures ten times larger, they’d still be ten times too small to do much—we are talking about addressing 100 million electric utility customers, and annually, the debate is not about whether we should double or triple the current one dollar per customer, but whether multiplying by ten or twenty will do. The complexities of retail markets involve a share of risk which some large IOUs may have been wise to steer away from, while others in more favorable markets may have managed well by working through subsidiaries that have been embracing it.   Consider the size of some of the big players in the Retail Power Marketer segment.  Each of the following eleven Retail Power Marketers reported more than $1 billion in U.S. electric sales revenue to EIA last year: Retail Power Marketers Reporting More than $1 billion in Annual U.S. Sales: Constellation NewEnergy TXU Energy Retail Direct Energy Business Reliant Energy Retail Services First Energy Solutions Corporation Just Energy Suez Energy Resources North America Noble Americas Energy Solutions Direct Energy Constellation Energy Services Ambit Energy Holdings Consolidated Edison Solutions How do such companies compare when it comes to their spend on advertising?  While it is not an apples-to-apples comparison, and not all such companies are publicly traded, data from the Annual Report of one of them (Just Energy—per page 91 of this link) showed a 19% spend on Sales and Marketing in its FY 2015 ($225 million out of a $3.8 billion revenue figure). Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 William G Jackson Jr on Oct 28, 2016 It would seem reasonable that utility advertising budgets would be significantly less than that of multi-national companies. Also, including customer service type expenses, like promotion of website services should also be considered. An excellent article that actually supports the customer-smart use of revenues by utilities. reply Log In or Register to post comments Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your TDWorld ID Email: Your comment: * Advertisement Related Articles BGE Engages Customers Wholesale Markets Meet Demand Response Ontario Implements Demand Response Demand-Response Efforts Grow A New Breed of Cooperative Connect Advertisement Latest News Nov 17, 2016 Humor T&D World Magazine Crossed Wires: Rural Circuits 1 Check in with Hinterland Electric's mobile command....More Nov 16, 2016 User Submitted Content Grid Optimization What is the Most Frequent Cause of Outages? 2 The most important metric in the power industry is the percentage of time we keep the lights on....More Nov 16, 2016 News TVA to Sell Bellefonte Nuclear Plant Nuclear Development has entered into a contract to purchase the partially completed Bellefonte Nuclear Plant from the Tennessee Valley Authority...More Nov 16, 2016 News ABB and Aibel to Partner on Offshore Wind Connections ABB and Aibel have announced a partnership to deliver offshore wind integration solutions....More Latest on T&D How™ Oct 13, 2016 Education T&D World Magazine Where Can You Go with T&D HOW Videos?

Big names, big checks behind Cincy school levy Hannah Sparling , hsparling@enquirer.com 5:17 p.m. EDT October 28, 2016 Buy Photo Hope Johnston-Holm of Pleasant Ridge gathers campaign signs at the Issue 44 campaign headquarters in Walnut Hills. (Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar)Buy Photo Scroll to the bottom of this story to read the finance reports.  If the Cincinnati Public Schools/Cincinnati Preschool Promise levy fails this Election Day, it won’t be for lack of big-name backing. Nor for lack of big checks. Recent campaign finance reports show the Issue 44 team has raised about $1.26 million to make its pitch to voters. That’s more than 10 times as much as the last successful new-money campaign for CPS in 2008. Donations then to the main campaign committee totaled around $117,000, according to board of elections records. There are seven Hamilton County school levies on the ballot this election, and the other six campaigns are working with just over $5,000 to just over $31,000 each. That’s not necessarily apples-to-apples, because big-city schools generally tend to play with more – more students, more money, bigger campaigns. But, it demonstrates how other school campaigns are faring this year. Issue 44 campaign director Brewster Rhoads said the amount raised depicts the breadth of support behind the levy. People believe in CPS schools, Rhoads said – as evidenced by growing enrollment – and they believe in preschool. It's a chance to cut child poverty and increase the number of qualified, ready-to-work graduates, Rhoads said. It’s a chance to spend more on education now but less on incarceration later. “You have a chance to make dramatic and rapid progress,” he said. “It’s exciting. … But we don’t take anybody’s vote for granted. We’re just working our tails off.” It is a $48 million a year, five-year levy. If it passes, it will cost homeowners in the CPS district an extra $278 a year for each $100,000 of home value. Worthy of note in the financial filing: The biggest donation is a $200,000 check from the United Way of Greater Cincinnati Foundation. The United Way has deep ties to the levy, though; if it passes, United Way will be in charge of forming a new nonprofit to oversee the $15 million a year preschool expansion.  The Greater Cincinnati Foundation gave $125,000 and Cincinnati Children's Hospital gave $30,000.  The report is peppered with local businesses. Procter & Gamble gave $175,000, for example. Kroger Co. and Cintas Corp. gave $30,000 each. And Fifth Third Bancorp, Western & Southern Financial Group and PNC Financial Services Group each chipped in $50,000. There are a lot of powerful Cincinnatians on the list. Frances Pepper, the wife of retired P&G chairman John Pepper, donated $25,000. Reds owner Robert Castellini and the Castellini Co. LLC donated $25,000. Councilman Chris Seelbach gave $44. The business community clearly wants this levy to pass, evidenced by its big, lucrative push. But there are still opponents: those who do not think CPS is doing a good job with the funds it already has, those who worry about pass-on costs to the same poor families this levy is supposed to help and those who, quite simply, do not want higher taxes. Board of elections records only go back six years, but in 2002, CPS ran a bond issue that failed, Rhoads said, and the budget for that was about $750,000. So, adjusting for inflation, the $1.26 million raised this year is not a crazy amount. The 2008 victory was during a presidential primary rather than a general election. Voter turnout will be much higher this time around, and that is likely good for the Issue 44 team. But, Rhoads said, it also means more people to reach with their message – more door-to-door canvassing, more rallies, more yard-signs, more phone banking. And that, he said, means more money. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eUKAKP TOP VIDEOS La Salle wins regional championship 0:55 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Joe Deters: \u0022I didn't believe the tears for a second\u0022 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 More Stories What are the questions Tensing jurors asked during deliberations?

If AT&T survives regulatory scrutiny without having to divest too many assets, the new AT&T will become the nation’s No. 1 advertiser — leaping past Procter & Gamble, the maker of toilet paper, toothpaste and laundry detergent. The mega-merger is expected to take a year to close. Dallas-based AT&T spent $3.9 billion on US ads in 2015, according to Advertising Age data, more than double the $1.7 billion spent by Time Warner. Together, the combined companies will leap frog over P&G’s $4.3 billion ad spend and into the No. 1 spot with a combined total of roughly $5.6 billion. AT&T ads for its DirecTV unit are currently on the air. The firm’s new product, DirecTV Now, an online cable-like bundle of 100 channels is set to get a marketing push for its Nov. 4 launch. AT&T would become the biggest media owner, leaping over Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, but would sit behind Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook in terms of market capitalization.

W+K will be tasked with developing integrated marketing promoting all Duracell brands, including digital, social, TV, experiential and design initiatives. Its first work for Duracell is expected some time in early 2017. “At Duracell, we strive to make world-class advertising and we are looking forward to partnering with W+K NY,” Duracell vice president of marketing Ramon Velutini said in a statement. “They have a proven track record of fueling iconic brands and we are excited to see what we can to together.” “Duracell is a great American brand. They make a trusted product that’s part of people’s everyday lives, and they have a real appetite for breakthrough work that will resonate in culture,” added W+K New York executive creative director Karl Lieberman. “All of this adds up to an ideal partner for us. We’re looking forward to helping to build the brand and sell some batteries.” According to Kantar Media, the brand spent around $30 million on measured media in 2015 and $11 million during the first half of this year. The latter figure is up from spending over the same period in 2015, but spending appears to be down from 2014, when the brand reportedly spent $50 million. W+K takes over for MDC Partners’ Anomaly, which won the account following a 2014 review. Anomaly’s recent work for the brand includes a Rogue One-themed holiday spot launched earlier this month, which follows a similar “Battle For Christmas Morning” effort released last year ahead of the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Anomaly announced earlier this month that it was not participating in the review, which followed Berkshire Hathaway’s acquisition of Duracell from P&G. Anomaly sent us the following statement from CEO Carl Johnson: “In the week where we have been fortunate to win Best in Show at the ANA Multicultural Excellence Awards for our work on Duracell and also having just released our second high-profile Duracell/Star Wars Holiday campaign, we are announcing our parting of the ways with the company. Back in Spring, several weeks after completing the acquisition of Duracell from P&G, and following the departures of the previous Global CEO, and the General Manager of Duracell, North America, new owners, Berkshire Hathaway, decided to review all aspects of the business including their marketing agencies. This is 100 percent their right. It is also 100 percent our right to choose not to participate in the process; which is what we decided to do in this instance. Whilst ending our role as AOR at the end of June, in the spirit of partnership and professionalism, we agreed to continue working through to the end of the year, solely focusing on the completion of the Star Wars Holiday campaign which we have now successfully launched. We love the Duracell brand and are very proud of our work we made together over the years. We wish the new owners well and will be moving onto the many new opportunities in front of us.” That doesn’t exactly explain why they sat it out, but last week Johnson told Campaign that Duracell’s new leadership no longer had “shared ambition and shared values” in common with Anomaly. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Most Popular Berkshire Hathaway's Duracell has named Wieden & Kennedy, New York, as agency of record, the company said in a statement. Credit: Duracell The move comes around seven months after the brand moved to Berkshire from Procter & Gamble Co. But it may have more to do with a change in marketing leadership on the brand. Former Duracell VP-marketing Jeff Jarrett left this summer to become chief marketing officer of housewares marketer Everyware Global. Ramon Velutini, who had been a brand manager on Duracell at P&G and marketing director once the brand went to Berkshire, succeeded him. Wieden arrives on the scene only two years after Anomaly took the account from its long-time incumbent Acme Idea Co. following a review. And it comes amid renewed creative focus on the category, following rival Energizer parting with longtime agency TBWA/Chiat Day last year and naming Camp & King as its lead shop earlier this year. Energizer launched a new campaign with a redesigned, slimmer bunny in September. In a statement, Anomaly Global CEO Carl Johnson said Anomaly chose not to participate in the review that Wieden won, and said the agency change came following a review of all aspects of the Duracell business by Berkshire Hathaway that followed the departures of the brand's prior global CEO and general manager of Duracell North America. Anomaly actually ended its AOR role at the end of June, he said. "This is 100% their right," Mr. Johnson said. "It is also 100% our right to choose not to participate in the process." He noted that the news comes within a week of Anomaly winning a Best of Show at the ANA Multicultural Excellence Awards and releasing its second high-profile Duracell/Star Wars holiday campaign. "We love the Duracell brand and are very proud of our work we made together over the years," Mr. Johnson said. "We wish the new owners well and will be moving onto the many new opportunities in front of us." Duracell spent $25 million on measured media last year, according to the Advertising Age Datacenter, down 19% from the year earlier.

"They have a proven track record of fueling iconic brands, and we are excited to see what we can do together." Wieden New York Exec Creative Director Karl Lieberman said, "Duracell is a great American brand. They make a trusted product that's part of people's everyday lives, and they have a real appetite for breakthrough work that will resonate in culture. All of this adds up to an ideal partner for us. We're looking forward to helping build the brand and sell some batteries." The battery business – at least the part that Duracell and Energizer compete in – has been in long-term decline as device trends moved toward things that take different types of batteries. That led P&G to divest the brand, and Energizer to split off its faster-growing Edgewell personal-care business in recent years. But the category has had a bit of a resurgence since those deals were first announced in late 2014, with sales up 0.6% to $2.8 billion for the 52 weeks ended Oct. 8, according to Nielsen data from Deutsche Bank. That doesn't include the faster-growing e-commerce channel. Energizer has been doing particularly well, with growth accelerating since its new advertising went live. Sales were up 13.6% and market share up 2.7 percentage points for the four weeks ended Oct. 8. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Mr. Velutini had been a marketing director at P&G. He became marketing director just after the brand went to Berkshire Hathaway in March. The story was also updated with a statement from Anomaly Global CEO Carl Johnson.

By Ray Fittipaldo/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette It started with some twerking in the season opener and ended with a player suspension in what figures to be the most important game of the regular season. In between, As The Steelers Turned played on. There was the curious timing of a complaint about hard practices following a convincing home victory that brought the record to 4-1. And there was the weekly Antonio Brown dress code/touchdown celebration drama. The first half of the season might as well have been sponsored by Procter and Gamble. Am I the only one who wants this show cancelled? The drama-filled season started when Brown drew a flag for twerking following a touchdown in the season-opening victory in Washington. For the next several weeks Brown was asked more about penalties and fines for touchdown celebrations than anything having to do with the wins the Steelers were stacking. Brown twerked again against the Chiefs, was fined again and asked the same questions again. Was he putting himself before the team? Would he stop celebrating touchdowns? Why not just change it up and hand the ball to the official after you score? Brown’s response to the final one? “No, I’m going to do what I want.” If that quote doesn’t sum up what Brown is all about I don’t know what does. When Brown wasn’t getting asked about twerking in the first half of the season he was inviting questions about violating the NFL’s dress code nearly every week. During the game with the Jets an official told Tomlin Brown wouldn’t be able to continue in the game if he didn’t take off his Muhammad Ali tribute shoes. Tomlin had to tell Brown to remove the shoes and change into new ones in the middle of the game. Even when the team’s captains try to do something they believe is leading they end up causing some drama. Ben Roethlisberger no doubt was speaking for others when he brought up the practice regimen. But the only thing that knocked practice-gate off the airwaves of local talk radio was a humiliating road loss to the Dolphins. Last week, defensive captain Cam Hewayrd said “It was just like we quit” following the 27-16 loss to the Patriots. It’s a rare step for a captain of a professional sports team to suggest his teammates quit, and his coaches had to awkwardly answer questions about it the next day.  But at least Roethlisberger and Heyward had their hearts in the right place. They were trying to lead.  As for Brown? Who knows what his motives are?  Tomlin should take a cue from the other championship coach in town. He should tell his players what Mike Sullivan told the Penguins upon his hiring: “Just play.” Onto this week’s picks. I finally had some good karma with my best week yet. We’re 16 games above .500 through seven weeks.

After almost two years of litigation, Seventh Generation reportedly agreed to pay a $4.5 million settlement over allegations that it deceptively marketed, labeled, and promoted its cleaning and personal care products as ‘natural.’ The case, which was settled before it went to trial at courts in California and New York, stemmed in part from the fact that Seventh Generation admitted in a document on its website that it used synthetic ingredients in several products. Those substances include glycerin, sodium citrate and sodium hydroxide. The plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit alleged that by describing its products as “natural,” the company deceived customers into paying a premium for goods such as dish soap, surface cleaners and laundry detergent. This summer, the Vermont-based company unsuccessfully argued for the cases to be dismissed. When those attempts failed, the company agreed to pay a settlement after a year of negotiations. Seventh Generation also said it would remove labels such as ‘all natural’ and ‘100 percent natural’ from its packaging. It will also clarify how it defines terms such as ‘hypoallergenic’ and ‘nontoxic.’ Plaintiffs suing the company claim the use of chemicals such as methylisothiazolinone and benzisothiazolinone, which are antimicrobial preservatives, further confused customers. Clearly wanting to sweep this controversy under the carpet, at press time Seventh Generation made no mention of the settlement by press release. Seventh Generation’s competitors have challenged the veracity of its products’ safety for years. In 2010, the consumer packaged goods (CPG) giant Procter & Gamble accused the company of making false claims that its products lacked any harmful ingredients and were completely natural. As a result, Seventh Generation removed a video, which also asserted that P&G’s brands posed risks to consumers, from its website. Ironically, Seventh’s Generation’s enduring success has proven to become one of many thorns in P&G’s side as investors become increasingly worried about the Cincinnati-based company’s financial performance. As Bloomberg reported this month, companies including Tom’s of Maine, Method Home and the Honest Co. – all of which were nailed for ‘natural’ claims – contributed to P&G’s recent woes as more consumers want more sustainable products. Many of these smaller companies’ products are now mainstream and readily available in retailers such as Target, Walmart and Costco. Meanwhile, Unilever has proven adept at identifying niche companies that can add value to its portfolio. Starting with Dollar Shave Club, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate is on a spending spree that included an interest in the Honest Co. before its September announcement that it would acquire Seventh Generation. Hence the eventual decision for Seventh Generation to settle its litigation in order to maximize its going price, which was reportedly an estimated $700 million. Seventh Generation joins a long list of companies targeted for making ‘natural’ claims that many consumer groups find nebulous. Six years ago, Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s agreed to remove ‘natural’ from its colorful and cartoonish ice cream cartons. PepsiCo, another example of a multinational buying more niche and healthy brands, removed ‘all natural’ from its Naked Juice bottles after mounting complaints. This roster also includes the likes of Trader Joe’s, which was called out for listing ingredients such as evaporated cane juice (fancy speak for sugar) on its private-label food products. The lesson for all companies here is that any and all claims about their ingredients’ safety and origin must be watertight – or else these brands risk becoming ensnared in a social media frenzy or, even worse, costly litigation. To do otherwise ignores market realities. After all, products such as those labeled ‘organic‘ began to thrive not because of proven science, but because of exaggerated worries over conventional products. On that point, claims about so-called “dangerous” ingredients, such as methylisothiazolinone, are made by organizations such as the Environmental Working Group (which currently urges visitors to its site to first consider making a donation) are not made to protect consumers. And their fundraising models are often dependent on appealing to consumers’ worst fears. In turn, those worries fuel donations that allow this cycle to continue. Meanwhile, many consumers are still confused and do not know which brands to trust. CPG companies must decide whether they want to make exhaustive claims that their products are safe, or just eliminate them entirely. So, if you are still puzzled over whether you should buy cleaning products from the likes of Seventh Generation or those branded by P&G or Colgate-Palmolive, there is a middle ground: Clean your house with a 5 percent white vinegar solution. Unless, of course, you are gluten intolerant.

I can send you photos of my 3 year old’s scarred body from her allergy to Methylisothiazolinone. She was patch tested and biopsied and suffered greatly for over a year. The main culprits were baby wipes and detergent that were made by seventh generation. It is dangerous. Many people suffer. And people can become sensitized to it so we all have the capability of getting this allergy because the high percentage of the ingredient that is in soaps, paints, glue and detergents.

The Paris appeal court confirmed a 2014 conviction of 13 sanitary product manufacturers, reducing the fine slighly but still leaving at a record level. The companies - Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Reckitt Benckiser, Sara Lee, SC Johnson and Bolton Solitaire, Laboratoires Vendôme, Gillette, Beiersdorf, Vania, Unilever, Procter & Gamble and L'Oréal - "coordinated their commercial policy towards supermarkets between 2003 and 2006,, in particular on price rises," the court ruled, confirming an earlier judgement. It reduced the fine slightly from 951.1 million euros to 948.9 million euros but the figure is still a record.

Featured links to other websites Huge price-fixing fine is upheld October 28, 2016 THE Court of Appeal has upheld a record-breaking fine for price-fixing imposed on 13 of the worlds largest consumer companies. The court ruled that the near-1bn fine handed out to multinationals Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Sara Lee, SC Johnson and Bolton Solitaire, Laboratoires Vendôme, Gillette, L'Oreal, Beiersdorf and Vania, should stand, though it did reduce the amount slightly from 951.1million to 948.9million. In December 2014, industry regulator the Autorité de la Concurrence had imposed sanctions totalling 345.2m in relation to price-fixing on cleaning products and a further 605.9m for price-fixing on personal hygiene products. It is the largest total fine the Autorité de la Concurrence has ever imposed. The previous highest was a 534m penalty imposed on mobile phone operators in 2005. The prices of popular brands in France were fixed, the regulator said - including Vanish stain remover, Palmolive washing-up liquid, Sanex and Petit Marseillais shower gels, shampoos including Head & Shoulders, and Colgate toothpaste, along with well-known brands of mouthwash, deodorant, shaving cream and razors. The regulator said that between 2003 and 2006, executives from the companies met 'regularly and secretly to coordinate their commercial policies and discuss their pricing policies'.

Josey High School junior Ladavious Sorrells, a participant in Textron Specialized Vehicles’ Reaching Potential through Manufacturing (RPM) program, assembles a speed control unit at the RPM campus Thursday Officials with Textron Specialized Vehicles and the Richmond County Board of Education cut a ribbon commemorating the opening of the Reaching Potential through Manufacturing campus. As an abused child, Kimberly Pritchett's focus wasn't on high school. Neither was Dayton Tritt's — his parents were drug addicts. Travon Anderson didn't think he would go back to school after getting expelled for fighting. And Leonka Carter missed so many classes because of leukemia, she thought graduation was out of reach. But all four Richmond County high schoolers, and 71 other at-risk students, are not only back on the path to completing their high school diplomas, but are earning money and learning skills that could land them high-paying manufacturing jobs. That's thanks to Textron Specialized Vehicles' newly created Reaching Potential through Manufacturing initiative, a school-to-work program known as RPM. It lets students put in eight-hour shifts at a special campus on Mike Padgett Highway to catch up on their studies, develop a work ethic and – possibly – get a chance to become a full-time Textron employee. Textron Specialized Vehicles President Kevin Holleran said the partnership with the Richmond County Board of Education aims to reduce the county's dropout rate and create a pipeline of potential employees, which the company needs to staff its growing local operations. In February, the maker of E-Z-GO, Cushman and Tug brand products acquired Augusta's former Procter & Gamble plant to expand production of its Bad Boy off-road vehicle line. And earlier this month it announced it would relocate its Charlotte, N.C.-based Jacobsen business to Augusta. Five years ago Textron employed 600 in Augusta. It expects to have 1,200 employees by the end of next year, Holleran said. "To continue that growth we must have a viable, well-educated and prepared workforce to be the engine behind our manufacturing," he said. "To have that workforce we felt we must build it. ... Our schools need our help, that's why we created RPM." The program was launched in August at the start of the regular school year, but its public unveiling was postponed until Thursday. RPM is modeled on a similar initiative created a decade ago by Carrollton, Ga.-based Southwire Co. RPM students feed Textron's four production lines with more than 130 parts – everything from brake cables to solenoids. Three lines are in the main E-Z-GO golf car factory on Marvin Griffin Road and one is in the former P&G plant, which produces the Bad Boy "Stampede" 4X4 off-road vehicle. "These student's aren't just bolting together parts," Plant Manager Heather Meyer said. "They're involved in every facet of this plant's operation. We expect these students to be leaders in running this plant. If this plant doesn't run well, then our other facilities are not going to run efficiently." The campus operates from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., as the four-hour classroom/four-hour manufacturing schedule allows for overlap. Lunches and dinners are transported to the campus from Butler High School, and each shift is staffed by three teachers. RPM Principal Jason Moore, formerly of Cross Creek High School, said the RPM students' days are essentially two hours longer than their traditional high school counterparts. "They're definitely putting in the work," he said. Holleran said the company has invested "more than $1 million" to turn the nearly 50,000-square-foot site – a former surplus warehouse co-owned by Richmond County and the school board – into classroom and manufacturing space. Richmond County School Superintendent Angela Pringle thanked Textron and its partners for the investment and for recognizing that "students do not always follow the same path to success." "Initially I coined the program a game-changing program," she said. "I've now come to know that this project is actually life-changing. And it's not just life-changing for the students involved in the program, it's life-changing for the students' families and the extended families." Pritchett, one of the RPM students, said the program is turning her life around. "This job and this opportunity has been the best thing for me since high school," she said. "It's really helped me get motivated. I have something to look forward to."

Knowing whether your fund manager has his or her own skin in the game tells you a lot about the incentives they have. INVESTOR CLINIC What if my broker goes bust? … and other reader questions Add to ... John Heinzl The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Oct. 28, 2016 5:30PM EDT Last updated Friday, Oct. 28, 2016 5:35PM EDT Comments Print / License AA What sort of protection for your funds do you get from a non-bank online broker (such as Qtrade or Questrade) compared to a bank-owned online broker (such as BMO InvestorLine or RBC Direct Investing) if the broker should go belly up? All investment dealers (including the ones you mentioned) that are members of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada are also automatically members of the Canadian Investor Protection Fund. CIPF covers property – including cash and securities – that is lost because of an investment firm’s insolvency. However, CIPF does not cover losses that arise because of bad investment advice, fraud or a drop in an investment’s value. Coverage is generally up to $1-million for all non-registered and tax-free savings accounts combined; $1-million for all registered retirement accounts; and $1-million for registered education savings plans. More information – and a list of CIPF members – is available at cipf.ca. How does an exchange-traded fund or stock open at a higher (or lower) price than it closed at the night before? This has always puzzled me. Market prices are determined by the “bid” (what a potential buyer is willing to pay) and “ask” (what a potential seller is willing to accept). As bids and asks change throughout the day, so too does the price at which a stock trades. It’s largely the same for ETFs, whose prices are determined by the value of their underlying securities. Lots of things can happen between the time the stock market closes and when it opens the next day – such as economic, earnings or political news – that cause bid and ask prices to change. As a result, the opening price of a stock or ETF is rarely the same as the previous day’s closing price. I see in your Strategy Lab model dividend portfolio that you own Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). They are very good individual stocks but would you consider, say, the Vanguard Large-Cap ETF that includes them? My reason for asking is that I am a pretty bad stock picker. If you don’t have the time or expertise to choose individual stocks then by all means consider an ETF. Just make sure you pick an ETF with low management expense ratio and a straightforward investing approach so you’ll know exactly what you are buying. The Vanguard Large Cap ETF (VV) fits the bill: It has an expense ratio of 0.08 per cent and holds more than 600 of the largest U.S. companies. Alternatively, you may wish to consider an S&P 500 index ETF or a large-cap U.S. dividend ETF. These ETFs will all have a fair amount of overlap in their holdings. Some Canadian investors prefer to buy currency-hedged U.S. ETFs but there are pros and cons to hedging, as I’ve discussed previously (tgam.ca/EQOO). You have mentioned that you generally try to keep your U.S.-listed stocks to less than 10 per cent of your portfolio. Why 10 per cent? That’s just my way of controlling my currency risk – the number is not carved in stone. Other people may have a higher – or lower – tolerance for currency volatility. Certainly, with the Canadian dollar plunging from more than $1 (U.S.) in early 2013 to its current level of about 75 cents, the more U.S. dollar exposure you had, the better your returns were. Now, however, I’m not as eager to stick my neck out currency-wise for the simple reason that a recovery in the Canadian dollar would pose a headwind. It’s worth pointing out, however, that many Canadian-listed companies – such as utilities, banks and insurers – have extensive U.S. or foreign holdings, so even a portfolio of strictly Canadian-listed stocks will have some U.S. dollar exposure. My daughter is now in a position to start investing in stocks but has no knowledge or understanding of markets. Could you suggest a good book or two that she could read that would be of assistance and give her some basic information to get started? I’m going to draw on the collective wisdom of Globe and Mail readers for this one. If you’ve come across a great introductory investing book (or website, YouTube channel or other resource), tell me about it in an e-mail and I’ll publish some of your tips in a future column.

(Photo: Provided/ Steven Chau for Techstars) The relationship between local startups and corporations is putting Cincinnati on the map as a destination city for entrepreneurial enterprise. The city hosted Techstar's largest annual conference "FounderCon" earlier this month, which brought more than 1,000 investors, entrepreneurs and corporate executives together to network. Techstars is a global ecosystem that helps entrepreneurs build their business and bring new technologies to market through a network of accelerators that extends across 15 cities and five countries. It focuses on building "up and coming" places, like Cincinnati. Techstars partner Ari Newman said the growing entrepreneurial mindset of large corporations and their support and engagement with startups in Cincinnati makes it unique. That relationship is raising the profile of this city's startup scene in terms of technology and innovation. CINCINNATI.COM Cincy startup scene sees biggest growth in the nation for 2016 Cincinnati is making the case that corporations should engage with and invest in startups. Why? Because startups are nimble and they can solve problems faster and cheaper than the corporate machine. Dave Drach, vice president of partnership at Techstars, said startups are the only place for corporations to tap into the disruptive chance that is necessary for them to be viable in the future. Cincinnati has the structure for big corporations and small enterprises to work together rather than against each other. "When that communication gap between the two is bridged, you start to see the innovation flow inside the corporations and success flow back to entrepreneurs in terms of their company's growth and that supports the entire ecosystem." He said tapping into startups can be a replacement for the research and development that was classically done inside a corporation and the innovation should be done externally. Startups are the key to corporate innovation Mark Finn, global transformation advisor at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said large corporations need to embrace the digitization of their businesses and business models. Consumers are demanding a digital experience, which is creating a lot of opportunities for new services and products to be brought to market. Techstars companies and corporations network at Techstar's annual conference FounderCon 2016 in Cincinnati.  (Photo: Provided/Steven Chau for Techstars) "It's critical to be engaged in the startup ecosystem for visibility into what's going on," Finn said. "And to learn how companies are bringing things to market with new models." Otherwise, he said, the corporations will wake up one day and realize they are irrelevant. That's where startups come in. "You have the scale and distribution, but you can't innovate as quickly as you can outside," Finn said. "That's what's driving this movement." Valerie Sheppard, comptroller and treasurer of Procter & Gamble, said working with startups and venture capitalists can provide solutions to business problems "that we might not otherwise see inside our four walls." The financial benefit comes from getting new innovation into their business and flowing that through to the consumers they serve. She said the company is also an investor in Cintrifuse and expects that to return a profit. Working with an early stage company does present some risks because they may not be around in a year or two. Finn said the big questions are "Is this a partner I can invest the resources in to work with longer term; and if it falls over, will it damage the brand?" A corporation such as PricewaterhouseCoopers that has more than 220,000 employees and does about $36 billion in revenue has a lot to lose. He said working with companies that have been filtered through Techstars is a way to mitigate that. "You have to balance that out with the risk of not innovating and not moving forward," Finn said. That corporate engagement can also spur growth for a startup. "The biggest thing an early stage company needs is customers and revenue and proof their solution is valuable in the market, which a corporation can offer them," Newman said. The startup can use early product market data to sell other customers, raise money and create more opportunities. Techstars companies and corporations network at Techstar's annual conference FounderCon 2016 in Cincinnati.  (Photo: Provided/ Steven Chau for Techstars) The success from those partnerships are a biproduct of events like FounderCon, Newman said. And they strengthen the economic development of the region. Techstar companies, investors and corporate representatives were matched and had more than 380 meetings with each other over two days at the conference. That is valuable because investors get to see high-quality, pre-vetted early stage companies in one place and the companies make their pitch to up to 10 people in one day, which usually takes months. Newman said in order for a startup community to thrive and grow, it takes participation from everyone that is vested in that community’s success. That includes angel investors, institutional funds, entrepreneurs, mentors and the city. "Everyone has to come together to elevate the activity and tell the story of why it’s a great community," Newman said. "Maybe FounderCon is a tipping point... that will put investors and companies in front of each other because we want to see them get funded." 93 CONNECTTWEET 49 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eEcWuA TOP VIDEOS Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Inside Prep Sports 360: Colerain Football prepares for playoffs 5:05 JP Macura looks ahead to the season 2:24 Entrepreneurs & Startups State awards millions to Cincy startup groups Kate Murphy Cincinnati saw strong startup growth in 2015, index shows Fatima Hussein NBC News profiles Cincinnati's Mortar program Bowdeya Tweh CompleteSet joins Techstars startup accelerator Bowdeya Tweh NKY startups to attend global entrepreneurship summit Fatima Hussein Small biz gets big showcase at XU Bowdeya Tweh This story is part of Entrepreneurs & Startups State awards millions to Cincy startup groups Cincinnati saw strong startup growth in 2015, index shows NBC News profiles Cincinnati's Mortar program

Chief Executive Officer John Hendrickson says an activist investor’s proposal to sell off the drugmaker’s generics unit, which last year generated 20 percent of its $5.35 billion in revenue, isn’t as simple as it sounds. “It ties into everything we do -- the production, the supply, the shipping, the materials, the bottles, the caps,” he said Thursday in an interview at the company’s Allegan, Michigan, operating headquarters. “We share plants” with the consumer health business.   Hendrickson, 53, is reviewing Perrigo’s portfolio as he settles into his seventh month on the job. Already he’s is under pressure from the activist investor, Starboard Value LP, which  disclosed last month that it held a 4.6 percent stake. The hedge fund criticized the company for mistakes made since the drugmaker rebuffed Mylan NV’s takeover bid almost a year ago and urged it to consider a sale of its prescription medicine unit as well as a royalty interest in multiple sclerosis therapy Tysabri. Hendrickson, who’s trying to boost Perrigo shares that have plummeted 55 percent since their April 2015 peak, hasn’t decided whether generics will remain. Pricing pressures that have made the business challenging in the past two years aren’t likely to get easier, he acknowledged. Yet he also likes the business because generics are profitable.  “Do we have to get it bigger to survive? Can we compete?” he asked. “Those are the challenges.” Activist Investor Hendrickson declined to comment on Starboard’s demands, though he said company executives met with the fund managers, as they would with any stockholder.  “We’ve had those conversations, but it’s been the same sort of discussions that we’ve had with the broad base of our shareholder group.” Speaking Thursday on Bloomberg TV, Starboard’s Jeff Smith said, “We have had discussions as it relates to the prescription business, and whether that really does fit or does not fit. We do want to understand the operational elements. Our view is that it is something that probably could be separated and create value for shareholders.” Smith later said, “I don’t think they are over-levered, but I do think there is an opportunity to be able to take down some of the debt.” Hendrickson said his review of the company’s operations inevitably overlaps with Starboard’s take. He’s also acknowledged that Tysabri isn’t part of its core business. He doesn’t agree with everything in Starboard’s letter, but “there wasn’t an ‘Oh wow, we didn’t think about looking at that one.’” He also said Perrigo has enough cash to meet its $5.5 billion in debt obligations. Over-the-Counter Drugs Perrigo, which keeps a legal address far from small-town Allegan, in Dublin, is the world’s largest producer of over-the-counter drugs and mostly makes store-brand versions of cold and allergy medicines. From 2009 to 2014 it more than doubled annual revenue to $4.17 billion. Its $13 billion market valuation has dropped from $23.3 billion two years ago but dwarfs the $1.5 billion it was worth in 2006, when Joe Papa became CEO. Hendrickson began his career at Procter & Gamble and joined Perrigo in 1989. He rose through the ranks, running operations and supply chain for eight years before becoming president late last year. When he walks through the company’s plants on its 2-million-square-foot campus, he greets workers by their first names, bumps fists to say hello and can explain the manufacturing process in as much detail as a white-coated engineer. Serial Acquirer The company was a acquisition machine under Papa, gobbling up at least a dozen companies. From March 2009 to April 2015, the shares soared 10-fold. In 2013, the company acquired Elan Corp. for $8.6 billion, gaining a lower tax rate and the Tysabri revenue. A $4.5 billion acquisition of Omega Pharma NV in 2014 allowed Perrigo to expand its international presence and grow its over-the-counter sales in Europe. Still, Hendrickson has no plans to resurrect Perrigo’s reputation as a serial buyer.  “My vision is we have a lot of good operating solid parts,” he said. “We’re a good business. We’ve got to focus on operating them, delivering value from all of those parts, making sure they’re clicking with high precision across the board.” Speaking in the company’s boardroom, Hendrickson said he’s interested in buying companies that align with its existing divisions and likely cost about $1 billion or less. Perrigo isn’t planning to “buy the next $10 billion thing” and plans to leave or downsize in some European markets, not expand into new ones. He’s also running Omega differently, better integrating it into the business. In his first week, he replaced two top managers in Europe. “It’s going to take a lot of work to get it to perform the way we have it set up in the U.S.,” which generates higher profit margins. Doesn’t Blame Papa In August, Perrigo lowered its full-year sales guidance as the company struggled, sending its stock plummeting. Hendrickson said at the time that Perrigo would set “realistic” forecasts, though he said Thursday that Papa isn’t responsible for its current condition.  “I personally don’t blame Joe for where we’re at. There’s been a lot of circumstantial changes that have impacted it,” he said. He said that the reduced 2016 guidance includes a drop in operating income of about $250 million because of price erosion in generics. “I don’t know where to get that $250 million of earnings overnight,” he said. “There’s not this slam dunk that says boy, now you’re there.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

United Way shifts funds in child poverty fight The Enquirer 4:10 p.m. EDT October 29, 2016 Buy Photo Julia Poston, 2015 Enquirer Women of the Year honoree, is the incoming chair of the United Way. (Photo: The Enquirer/Madison Schmidt)Buy Photo United Way of Greater Cincinnati will "redirect millions of dollars" in the effort to reduce child poverty in the city by 10,000 children or 5,000 families over the next five years, officials said Saturday. The shift could help curb Cincinnati's high child poverty rate – it ranks sixth highest among U.S. cities with populations of 300,000 to 600,000 in that indicator – but it could also mean that groups that traditionally have been recipients of United Way funds will see cuts. The incoming chair of the United Way, Julia Poston, said the funding agency was keeping its goal of boosting the region's education, income and health. But Poston told more than 700 people gathered for a Child Poverty Collaborative forum that the agency's board this week decided that progress in improving those areas had been "too incremental and too isolated." The idea is that a more targeted effort focusing on children and their families would do more good. "We're in this for the long haul," Poston told the gathering at Downtown's Duke Energy Convention Center. Details of the shift, which will occur over the next year, remain to be worked out, Poston said in a brief interview after the event concluded. United Way will be looking for "fundamental changes in social services" so they are more integrated to assist poor families, she said. Currently, "there's nobody to help them access all" that's available. Roughly half of $51 million that the funding agency gave out in 2015 went to groups or programs fighting poverty, said Poston, managing partner for the accounting firm Ernst & Young's Cincinnati's office. In 2011, United Way set six "bold goals" it had hoped to reach by 2020: In education, having 85 percent of children prepared for kindergarten; 85 percent of youths graduating from high school and prepared for the next step; and 45 percent of adults with an associate's degree or higher. In income, having 90 percent of the labor force gainfully employed. In health, having 95 percent of the community with a usual and appropriate place to go for health care; and 70 percent of the community having excellent or very good health. The funding agency announced Thursday it had topped its 2016 fund drive goal and raised a projected $62,115,000. It currently supports more than 280 programs, initiatives and community change efforts. Programs that will receive money from the 2016 drive will be announced in December. Saturday's meeting was convened by the Child Collaborative, which is funded mostly by private donors and was formed in 2015. The meeting served as the official "clock," starting the countdown to the goal of moving 10,000 children out of poverty. Shifting United Way's focus was one of five major recommendations to come out of months of information gathering, community meetings and study by the collaborative. The collaborative will continue to convene the community on the child poverty problem going forward, Executive Director Lynn Marmer said. Some anti-poverty steps will be worked by the collaborative, while others will be the province of other agencies or community groups, said Marmer, a former Cincinnati Public Schools board member and Kroger Co. vice president. Multiple speakers echoed the opening words of Mayor John Cranley, another one of the co-chairs. "What we're trying to do is big stuff," he said. "Everyone in the city, everyone in the region has a responsibility" to lend a hand. Other recommendations Using the lobbying power of the region's companies and business groups to boost existing policies to help poor people move to self-sufficiency, such as the earned income tax credit. Hosting a roundtable in the first quarter of 2017 of the human resource officers of Kroger, Procter & Gamble, Macy's, TriHealth and other companies to find ways to lower barriers for entry level jobs for people in poverty. Creating "one to one" relationships between poor families and the more well-to-do to coach, encourage and strategize on problems. "We will engage with these families for years, if necessary," said Michael Fisher, president of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and one of five co-chairs of the collaborative. Confidential data on what works and what doesn't work will be kept to refine approaches over time, he said. 142 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eH6bYG TOP VIDEOS La Salle wins regional championship 0:55 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Joe Deters: \u0022I didn't believe the tears for a second\u0022 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 More Stories What are the questions Tensing jurors asked during deliberations?

This philosophy has also led to staffing changes, including a round of downsizing in the New York office this week. “We have been very vocal and transparent about the exciting transformation underway at Publicis North America,” a spokesperson wrote today in a statement. “This includes making strong moves to continue to better serve our clients. Our New York headquarters office has been leading the way, and with the recent string of new business wins and creative accolades, continues to position for the future. Approximately 3% of our staff is affected.” We began hearing rumors of pending layoffs in September along with varied estimates of how many staffers would be affected. Publicis New York’s new Clive Wilkinson Architects office has no assigned desks, but it does reportedly employ more than 1,000 people, meaning that the 3% number applies to at least 30 individuals. According to our tipsters, the announcements began on Wednesday with more changes allegedly to come. Publicis declined to elaborate beyond the above statement. The primary motivation behind Publicis’ recent moves, which also saw the departure of global chief revenue officer Laura Desmond yesterday, is savings. Last week, the holding company reported that third quarter revenues grew by only 0.2% organically, and observers attributed this slowdown to last year’s loss of several massive media accounts including, most prominently, P&G. That said, Publicis has recently won several pieces of new business including Walmart and USAA. In both of those cases, the Groupe applied the “Power of One” approach and won via “umbrella” units that included Saatchi & Saatchi and several other agencies within the Publicis family. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The Exelon Corp. subsidiary will build an 8.5-megawatt biomass-fueled generator, lighting and boilers, transformers and controls for a landfill gas electricity generator as well as centralized monitoring of electricity generation and distribution efforts at the Albany, Georgia-based Marine Corps Logistics Base, Constellation said Thursday. Construction is scheduled to be completed by 2018. DCO Energy will provide engineering, procurement and construction services under the project while Schneider Electric will install the system controls. The 3,600-acre logistics base consists of nearly 400 facilities and Marine Corps-operated utility systems such as a 61-mile electrical distribution, 19-mile natural gas distribution, 87-mile storm water, wastewater and potable water lines. “Constellation is proud to support the U.S. Marine Corps’ energy and environmental goals and MCLB Albany’s efforts toward achieving net-zero energy use,” said Gary Fromer, senior vice president of Constellation’s distributed energy business. The Marine Corps, Constellation, NAVFAC, Procter & Gamble, Georgia Power, the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Albany-Dougherty Payroll Development Authority worked together for five years to plan the MCLB Albany’s energy project.
