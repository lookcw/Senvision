Is it too little too late? Mobile by Sean Hollister December 27, 2016 12:00 PM PST @starfire2258 Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them If Microsoft could go back in time, I've a pretty good idea what would happen. CEO Satya Nadella would hand his younger self the code for Microsoft's new Win32 on ARM emulator. It's the missing piece of the puzzle that could finally let Microsoft build Windows phones, razor-thin tablets and tiny laptops that people might actually want to buy. It could have maybe saved Microsoft billions of dollars and thousands of jobs, if the company had had it just a few years ago. See, Win32 refers to the traditional Windows desktop apps you know and love, like Office and Photoshop, VLC and Steam. Thing is, the versions of Windows that ran on phones or thin tablets never could use those all-important Win32 apps -- because the energy-efficient ARM processors that powered those devices weren't compatible. Would you rather have a thicker tablet, or a thinner, cheaper tablet that couldn't run all your apps? That was the choice in 2012, but Microsoft didn't make it clear.Photo by Josh Lowensohn/CNET It was actually quite the scandal back in 2012, when Microsoft tried to sell the first Microsoft Surface RT tablet with a stripped-down version of Windows -- Windows RT -- instead of the real thing. Microsoft lost nearly a billion dollars when the Surface RT didn't sell, and nearly $8 billion more when it had to write off all its Nokia phones. But this year, Microsoft says it's finally cracked the code. On December 7, the company announced it would bring the full Windows 10 operating system, including Win32 apps, to ARM-based Qualcomm processors. That means real Windows desktop apps could run on phones -- and beyond. Is it too little too late? Here are five reasons why this single achievement could change the computing landscape -- and three ways it could fail yet again. Why Windows on ARM could succeed Enlarge Image The Surface Book is nearly an inch thick. (The Surface Pro 4 is a third of an inch -- but the iPad is less than a quarter-inch thick.)Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET 1) Windows tablets could trounce the iPad The Surface Pro and Surface Book might be awesome Windows computers, but no one's mistaking them for an Apple iPad -- they're comparatively thick, heavy and generally far more expensive. Meanwhile, Apple's iPad still hasn't quite gotten to the point where it can replace a computer for many people. (That's probably why the Mac still exists.) Microsoft's Windows 10 OS has the chops to be for both a PC and a tablet, but few companies have managed to produce a competitive tablet using Intel processors. (The Samsung TabPro S is an exception to the rule.) Qualcomm's chips, with built-in wireless connectivity, could bring the battery life and always-on internet connection that Intel hasn't up to now. 2) Windows phones could turn up the heat HP's Elite x3 turns into a Windows desktop when you dock it. It can even run Win32 desktop apps -- if you pay for HP to host them on cloud servers.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Right now, Android and Apple are your only viable options for a smartphone, but that could change. Windows phones -- ones that support all the traditional Windows apps, anyhow -- might be attractive enough to pose a real alternative. What if your phone could turn into a full Windows desktop or laptop when you plug it into a dock? It's an idea that's been tried before, but never with a Windows desktop that actually ran desktop apps on the phone itself. That's now theoretically possible with Windows on ARM, and it's something both PC makers and phone makers can now pursue. If enough people buy into the idea, the mobile app developers that once skipped Windows Phone might give it another chance, too. 3) VR and AR Windows is where the hottest virtual and augmented reality experiences live, but they're not particularly portable. They're all either tethered to Windows desktops or laptops, or have poor battery life (Microsoft HoloLens). To cut the cord and venture out into the real world with smaller, standalone headsets, we need lightweight, always-connected-to-the-internet processors that last more than a few hours on a charge. That's what Qualcomm's ARM chips do best, by baking the cellular radios right into the processor instead of requiring additional components. 4) Laptops get cellular superpowers, too How often do you wish your laptop had a cellular connection? Terrible coffee shop Wi-Fi could be a thing of the past with an ARM-powered Windows device. Today, you don't see a lot of cellular-powered laptops because it's a huge design constraint: Manufacturers have to make room for a removable cellular module and a SIM card tray, and install software to control the whole thing. But again, Qualcomm's chips have cellular built right in, and Microsoft says Windows will natively support tiny embedded reprogrammable SIM cards (eSIM) so there's no need to swap out SIMs. Of course, not every manufacturer will go to the trouble of adding cellular antennas, and you'll still need a data plan, but you can probably expect cellular models to be way more affordable than the $150-$300 premium you might pay today. (Plus, prices might come down if Intel and Qualcomm are competing to be in your next PC.) With fast future 5G networks, there may come a time when cell connectivity is the norm for computers. The Oculus Santa Cruz prototype. Facebook's Oculus, Intel, Microsoft and Qualcomm all believe that standalone wireless VR headsets might be a new opportunity.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET 5) ARM processors might be fast enough to rival Intel chips now Sure, your phone isn't anywhere near as fast as a beefy gaming PC packed with Intel, AMD and Nvidia processors -- but you might be surprised how far mobile processors have come. In one benchmark, the ARM chip inside Apple's new iPhone 7 actually beats the Intel ones inside Apple's MacBook Air. The eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, the processor that Microsoft is targeting for this new Windows release, could be even more powerful. Putting benchmarks aside, Microsoft showed off a Windows 10 machine running Adobe Photoshop on a quad-core Snapdragon 820, and you can bet that tomorrow's eight-core Snapdragon 835 will be a good bit faster than that. Why Microsoft could crash and burn yet again 1) Windows desktop apps could still be slow Here's the thing about Microsoft's newfound app support: It uses an emulator, and emulators have a tendency to slow everything down. The emulator is a piece of software that lets your ARM-based Snapdragon chip pretend to be an Intel-like x86 processor, and every CPU cycle that maintains the disguise is one that's not being used to actually run your app. Which means that even if the Snapdragon 835 is just as fast as a comparable Intel chip, things will probably run a bit slower. We can't say how much slower, and Microsoft has built some impressive emulators in the past -- the Xbox One can now play Xbox 360 games thanks to the company's work. And a Microsoft representative tells CNET that Windows on ARM is relatively fast: "People will experience apps at a similar speed to what they experience on other, similarly priced PCs." Still, "there is always an overhead associated with emulation," Moor Insights and Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead tells us -- and also notes that emulators sometimes have difficulty supporting external devices like printers and scanners. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET 2) Who's going to actually build a Windows phone? Sure, Windows Phones could make meaningful competition for iPhone and Android -- but who's going to stick their necks out? Probably not Microsoft, whose phone ambitions got squashed when it had to part ways with Nokia. (We do still hear rumors about a Surface Phone, though.) Laptops and tablets are one thing, but a bunch of companies got burned trying to support the last big batch of Windows Phones (and Windows RT tablets), including a couple that have since called the phone business quits (Nokia and Dell). Are any OEMs brave enough to wholeheartedly support Microsoft against Apple and Google this time around? 3) Customers might not trust Microsoft again Microsoft is the proverbial boy who called wolf -- year after year, the company promised you'd finally be able to get full Windows on a thin tablet or phone. Even if that's about to become true, would you buy a Windows Phone or iPad-like device knowing how previous customers were left out in the cold? Microsoft's biggest fans who bought into Windows Phone found themselves unable to upgrade to newer versions of the operating system, and Microsoft did a pretty crappy job explaining to customers that Windows RT tablets wouldn't run their desktop apps. If Microsoft comes out and says, "No, this time we really mean it, you can actually have a functional Windows desktop on a tiny device," will customers believe them? Qualcomm tells CNET the first such devices will go on sale late in 2017. I guess that's when we'll know for sure.

Brokers have detailed how that could affect Bay Area homebuyers over the life of a mortgage. By Richard Scheinin | rscheinin@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: December 27, 2016 at 10:15 am | UPDATED: December 28, 2016 at 5:30 am There’s been a lot of recent chatter about rising mortgage rates and what they might mean for Bay Area buyers. Loan rates have climbed three-fourths of a point since late October. Given that punishing down payments and large monthly mortgage bills have been part of the natural order here for years, what does it all add up to for the brave folks who are out there hunting for a house? “They’re not calling me in a panic because interest rates are going up,” said Julie Thall, a San Mateo-based mortgage and financial adviser. “For the first-time homebuyer earning $120,000 — yes, it’s certainly tighter. But I have several Facebook and Apple clients, young high-tech workers, and their problem tends to be not yet having enough for a down payment, more than their inability to make the monthly mortgage payments.” Low rates over the past decade have spoiled buyers, she said, and the new “`high’ rates are still historically low,” and should not push many out of the market. Starting in late October, mortgage rates began to rise. They took a significant jump after the presidential election in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise the federal benchmark rate. That decision came earlier this month. Mortgages aren’t directly linked to the Fed’s benchmark; still, markets have a way of broadly influencing one another. In this context, we asked Thall to do some computations: As mortgage rates rise, how much more will buyers shell out for their monthly payments and in total interest paid over the life of a loan? Reading this on your iPhone or iPad? Check out our new Apple News app channel here and click the + at the top of the page to save to your Apple News favorites. Thall drew up three hypothetical mortgage packages, each assuming 20 percent down on a 30-year fixed loan: One for $520,000 (on a $650,000 home, perhaps a townhome on the Peninsula or a single-family house in Contra Costa County); one for $800,000 (on a $1 million home); and another for $1,280,000 (on a $1.6 million home). For each, she computed what the monthly payment and 30-year interest outlay would have been back in October at 3.75 percent; what they would be right now, when rates are running around 4.5 percent; and what they would be at 5 percent, should rates climb that high in 2017. The increased costs for buyers are substantial. Snapshot One: For the $520,000 loan at 3.75 percent, the monthly payment would have locked in at $2,408 and interest payments would have totaled $346,952 over the life of the loan. Today at 4.5 percent, that same loan would carry a $2,634 monthly payment and interest payments of $428,515 — a jump of more than $81,000 — over the 30 years. At 5.0 percent, the monthly payment would rise yet again to $2,791 and interest payments would come to $484,930 — about $138,000 more than at the 3.75 percent rate over the life of the loan. Snapshot Two: For the $800,000 loan at 3.75 percent, the monthly payment would have been $3,704 and total interest would have been $533,773. Now at 4.5 percent, those numbers would move to a monthly payment of $4,053 and total interest of $659,254 — a boost of more than $125,000 in interest paid. At 5.0 percent, they would be about $4,294 monthly and $746,046 in total interest — about $212,000 more than at October’s rate of 3.75 percent over the duration of the loan. Snapshot Three: For the $1,280,000 loan at 3.75 percent, a buyer would have paid $5,927 monthly at 3.75 percent, along with total interest of $854,037. At 4.5 percent, the numbers go to $6,485 monthly and $1,054,806 in interest – a $200,000 jump. At 5.0 percent, the numbers jump again to $6,871 monthly and $1,193,674 in interest – a $339,000 increase above the total when it was 3.75 percent. Ouch, right? Thall said it’s by no means a given that rates will reach 5 percent in the coming year. Given the vagaries of markets, she thinks it’s possible that rates will actually fall again at some point down the road. Regardless, a $1,280,000 loan doesn’t necessarily get anyone a palace as 2017 approaches. In San Mateo County, the median price of a single family home is $1,268,000, according to a report issued last month by the CoreLogic real estate information service. Thall noted that low rates combined with the tight housing supply have driven up prices in recent years, bringing out buyers and setting the stage for bidding wars. Now that rates are going up — generally seen as a sign of an improving economy — price appreciation may finally flatten and employers might even dole out some raises, putting additional money in homeowners’ pockets. She didn’t minimize the difficulties of buying in the current market. It’s just that “it’s challenging whether it’s 3.75 or 4.5 percent,” she said. Assuming careful financial planning, she added, buyers who qualified for a loan at 3.75 percent should have more than enough wiggle room to handle 4.5 percent. Julie Ray, a Coldwell Banker agent on the Peninsula, said she expects three-fourths of her clients to be unaffected by the rate hike. “But there are a few who definitely will get priced out next year if the interest rate goes up a point,” she said. “They’re first-time buyers and they’re just cutting it really close already, and it would not be good.” She called the situation “a tricky one.” Kevin Kieffer, a Keller Williams agent based in Danville, thinks buyers have been motivated by the rate increases, at least for the short term. “We haven’t had people saying, `Oh, geez, rates are going up, and we’d better not buy anything.’ If anything, people are a little bit more keen on making sure they get something before rates go up again.” The next psychological barrier would be 5.0 percent, he said. “At that point, you’ll see a softening at the higher end of the market,” Kieffer said. Right now in Walnut Creek, the sweet spot is between $1 million and $1.2 million. If we start going over 4.75… you’ll see less buyers qualify at this price point and so they’ll move down into the $900,000s.” Matthew Lucero agreed that a 5.0 percent interest rate could spell trouble in his search for a home. But right now, he and his wife Rebecca — first-time buyers and clients of Thall, the mortgage adviser — can handle the boost from 3.75 to 4.5 percent. Both work in tech. Their income gets them into the hunt for a house that costs around $1 million. The rate increase “adds another layer to an already difficult situation,” Lucero said. But his more critical problem is getting into a house at the listing price: While searching in recent months on the Peninsula and in the South Bay, he and Rebecca have run into stiff competition and bidding wars — even though the market is said to be cooling. It’s a frustration. They have only enough to make a down payment for a house in their price range, not for one that goes, say, for $100,000 or more over the asking price. For about a decade, while working in tech, Lucero said he has been “chasing the down payment. Five years ago, trying to get a house in Sunnyvale — I just never had enough. And I just barely have enough right now — and I’m just trying to get a modest home.” He and his wife pay more than $3,000 a month for an apartment in Mountain View: “We live so lean. We don’t live lavishly. We’re down to looking at food expenses, just to get that down payment. Still, to be able to save that much in 10 years to even be able to consider a down payment – none of my buddies have done that, I can tell you. It feels pretty good.” And his search continues.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Mobile Image Source: ThoroughlyReviewed This modified iPhone 7 is ultra secure, but it’ll cost you big bucks Mike Wehner @MikeWehner December 27th, 2016 at 11:46 AM Share Tweet Apple’s iPhone is already a pretty secure device, and the company has gotten a lot of good press for its habit of pushing back against law enforcement agencies who want an easy way to access its devices. But if Apple’s built-in security features and encryption just aren’t enough for you — or you don’t trust the company to keep your communications private — you have another, much more expensive option. It’s called the “K iPhone,” and it manufacturer says it’s the go-to choice for military personal, heads of state, and anyone who values their privacy. Don't Miss: Major torrent sites are offline thanks to mysterious cyber attacks The K iPhone is made by KryptAll, which sells several different pieces of encrypted communications gear, from the aforementioned Apple smartphone to a mobile broadband satellite communicator that can produce a cellular signal anywhere on the planet. KryptAll says its modified iPhone utilizes modified components, a custom firmware, and the company’s own VoIP app to make end-to-end encrypted phone calls to anyone in the world. But while it can make calls to any number, it can only take incoming calls from other KryptAll devices, to ensure security. The company says that phone calls made of its encrypted network cannot be tapped or tracked, and that not oven KryptAll has any way of knowing the details of the calls. The company’s guidelines for law enforcement describes it thusly: KryptAll provides VoIP audio calls that are secured by encryption. KryptAll is a zero knowledge system as calls are not stored on the server network and calling records are not generated. The KryptAll phone can make calls; however, cannot receive KryptAll calls unless it is from another KryptAll phone. We do not have a history or copies of calls exchanged by anybody on the system. We do not have the decryption keys thus we cannot intercept any of the calls sent through KryptAll. KryptAll does not assign or control IP the address. It’s super secure, but the K iPhone can also be used just like any other iPhone, and downloading apps and other common smartphone functions perform just as you’d expect. The company, which has been selling its encrypted devices for just a couple of years now, says it already has some extremely important clientele, including “privacy advocates” and executives from Rolls-Royce, Maybach, and other companies. That makes a lot of sense, because in order to afford one of these custom iPhones you’ll definitely need a pretty healthy paycheck. The devices, which the company sells on eBay for some reason, are several thousands of dollars each, and the current price of the iPhone 7 version is over $4,500.

The document describes a way to use artificial images to train computers to recognize real world objects, and is also a bit of a good faith gesture towards the open research philosophy in the AI community. Apple’s first AI white paper addresses more efficient object recognition learning Inside Apple’s Artificial Intelligence white paper The white paper is titled “Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training” and explains how synthetic images can be augmented with real images to help computers improve object recognition more efficiently and at a lower cost. The system works by blending tagged artificial images with untagged real images. The paper was authored by Ashish Shrivastava, Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Josh Susskind, Wenda Wang, and Russ Webb who dubbed the system “Simulated+Unsupervised learning.” The upside to S+U learning is a collection of highly realistic images AI systems can use to learn what an actual real-world item—such as a human eye or smile—looks like without relying on humans spending hours tagging images by hand. Their research and testing has focused on still images, but the group hopes to expand the work to include videos, too. Behind Apple’s Artificial Intelligence white paper Apple announced earlier this month it would let its engineers publish research white papers, which was a big departure from the company’s secretive nature. The S+U paper is presumably only the first in a larger series. The document is also an olive branch of sorts because it shows Apple’s intent to support the openness of the AI community where research is routinely shared so all can benefit. While the move is friendly gesture some level, it’s also self serving for Apple. Drawing in top talent in the AI field isn’t easy when researchers are told they can’t publish white papers about their research—a hurdle some say is keeping engineers away. Company CEO Tim Cook said that’s not so, and some engineers prefer to work in an environment where they aren’t expected to publish their research. Regardless, it seems at least some of the work they’re doing is open for public review. For Apple, openly participating in the AI community is a win all the way around: the company is participating in the AI research community, may be able to hire engineers who otherwise wouldn’t have considered Apple, and can choose what to share so the things it really wants to keep secret stay that way. You can check out Apple’s white paper at Cornell University Library’s arXiv website.

Better yet, the Smart Multicolor A19 doesn’t require a hub—just plug it in, find it with Apple’s Home app, and you’re good to go. Sylvania said the device will be sold through Amazon and ship in “early 2017.” This will be a great addition to the HomeKit ecosystem. To that end, I’ve been seeing more HomeKit stuff in my inbox during the last few weeks for CES 2017. It’s almost as if Apple’s smarthome platform is finally coming alive. Let’s hope, at any rate. I’ve left messages with Sylvania reps asking about pricing, which wasn’t announced. Sylvania also didn’t release images of the new bulb—the image below is of current products in the company’s smartbulb line. [Update: Sylvania’s PR folks got back to me—pricing is definitely unannounced. I also added a rendered image of the A19. We’ll be visiting with the company next week at CES. – Bryan] Check It Out: Sylvania Announces Smartbulbs for Apple HomeKit, No Hub Required [Update] The Mac Observer's CES 2017 coverage sponsored by: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: ces2017, HomeKit, Smartbulbs, Sylvania 2 Comments Add a comment Lee Dronick December 27, 2016 Not having a hub is nice so I am interested in this product. I couldn’t find any info as to if it is monochrome or color controlable like my HUE bulbs, and I very much like setting a candle and other mood scenes. As to HUE. Though I like the bulbs their app is horrid and I almost exclusively use Apple’s Home app. The only thing the HUE app has over Home is the ability to set a fade on or off. I wish that there was an OSX version of Home. December 27, 2016 at 10:41 EST PM Lee Dronick December 27, 2016 Digging a little deeper into stories about this I found that there will be hub free multicolor lights. Phillips will probably comeup with a bluetooth version of theirs lights. December 27, 2016 at 10:47 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

If you’re on the hunt to get yourself a pair, a new website launched just a few days ago aims to notify you the second AirPods become available in your local Apple Store. The website is simplistic in design, with a top banner dedicated to input fields for your email address and which Apple Store you’d like to be notified about. Once you enter that information, you’ll receive an email as soon as AirPods become available from that store. If you receive an email that stock has been replenished at your local store, you can either head there in person immediately or try your luck at reserving a pair for in-store pickup via Apple’s website. The website also lists all of Apple’s retail stores, allowing you to quickly see where AirPods are in stock and where they are sold out. The stores where supply is available are listed right at the top of the webpage. Apple Stores are generally receiving shipments of AirPods every day or so, sometimes more often depending on if it’s a flagship location. Other retailers such as Best Buy, Target, and mobile carriers are also receiving regular shipments of AirPods and we’re doing our best to keep track of those stock changes and share them as they come. AirPods were first available for order online two weeks ago. Those who ordered early received their shipment within just a few days, but shipping times began to slip rather quickly. It’s worth noting, however, that Apple seems to be fulfilling online orders at a faster rate than the 6 week window it quotes, suggesting that supply is gradually improving. If you’re still trying to get your hands on a pair of AirPods, head to AirPods In Stock to track supply. Another tool that’s widely used is iStockNow, which features a map interface.

Phones by Steven Musil December 27, 2016 2:38 PM PST @stevenmusil Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Jumbo phones like Apple's iPhone 7 Plus continue to gain in popularity, according to new data.Photo by James Martin/CNET Apple had nearly twice as many phone activations this holiday season as its rival Samsung, according to new research released Tuesday. About 44 percent of new phone activations during the holidays were Apple's iPhones, compared with Samsung's 21 percent, said mobile-app analytics firm Flurry. While the iPhone continues to be the gift of choice, Flurry noted Samsung is "slowly growing in popularity throughout the holiday season, up 1 percent from last year." Enlarge Image Photo by Flurry Rounding out the list of top manufacturers by activation were Huawei with 3 percent and LG, Amazon, Oppo, Xiaomi and Motorola with 2 percent each. The wide gap between the top two and the rest of the field underscores the long-standing domination Apple and Samsung have had over the global phone market. Medium-size phones, such as Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7, continue to be the most popular mobile type, but their popularity waned from 54 percent last year to 45 percent this holiday season, Flurry found. Some of that decline was due to phablets -- those oversized handsets like Apple's new iPhone 7 Plus -- which continue to eat away at sales of medium-size phones. During the holidays, phablets accounted for 37 percent of device activations compared with 27 percent during the 2015 holiday season, Flurry reported. The data, derived from examining app activations throughout the week leading up to Christmas day and the start of Chanukah, comes amid an industrywide "phone fatigue." Consumers in mature markets, like the US and China, have been turned off by a lack of exciting features in new phones, causing more of them to stick with their current smartphones.

Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favourable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device underperformed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the rollout of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10 per cent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky — opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and centre in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, Calif. headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips — a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple reorganized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 per cent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the colour didn't look good on such a large product. In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold colour option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the U.S. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, U.S. president-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the U.S. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our road map. Nobody should worry about that," chief executive officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touch screen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage.

This year has seen quite a number of notable deaths — from Alan Rickman and David Bowie to Prince and Muhammad Ali; and has also seen a great deal of historic and impactful events, such as Brexit, the various terrorist attacks in countries like France, Turkey, and Belgium, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and the Cubs winning the World Series. This year has also been an eventful year in tech. While there has been a lot of growth like the rise of Facebook Live, the popularity of AI assistants like Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa, and advances in the self-driving market — we’re taking a look at some events and products that didn’t have such a grand time (in no particular order). More: Google’s Year in Search brings you a message of hope A burst of fake news Fake news plagued the 2016 U.S. Election, but pledges to combat it only came after the results on November 8. Fake stories such as how the Pope endorsed President-Elect Donald Trump (he didn’t), and how Trump won the popular vote (he didn’t) offered a false narrative that reinforced beliefs. More: Influential or insignificant? A primer on Facebook’s fake news dilemma Things got so bad that Google changed its “In the news” section to “Top Stories” after one search result showed Trump as the winner of the popular vote. Facebook had an even bigger problem as the top three fake news stories “generated more engagement” than the top stories from sites like The New York Times and the Washington Post, according to Buzzfeed News. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced plans to combat fake news on the social media platform by making it easier to report fake stories, as well as hiring third-party groups of fact checkers from organizations like ABC News, the Associated Press, Snopes, Politifact, and FactCheck. Tech giants face a lot of the blame for perpetuating fake news on their platforms, and it’s certainly affecting people. A Stanford University study found that more than 80 percent of students surveyed could not tell the difference between fake and real stories. This year highlighted the importance of fact-checking. Encryption: Apple vs. the FBI Last year, two terrorists killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. While the shooters were fatally shot in the aftermath, the attack ended up turning into a political and tech battle between the FBI and Apple. One of the shooters left behind a locked iPhone — the FBI wanted to get in, and while Apple offered assistance at first, the company rejected a court order demanding the creation of a backdoor. Read More More: Apple vs. the FBI: A complete timeline of the war over tech encryption Apple claimed the creation of a backdoor would be “too dangerous” as it would open iOS to security and privacy threats. “The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation,” said CEO Tim Cook said in a customer letter. “In the wrong hands, this software — which does not exist today — would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical possession.” Most of Silicon Valley sided with Apple, and politicians weighed in on the issue — even President Barack Obama urged tech companies to compromise on encryption. Eventually, the case was dropped as the FBI hired third-party gray hat hackers to unlock the iPhone. But the battle highlighted a problem plaguing local and federal law enforcement — that there are hundreds of encrypted smartphones and laptops sitting in evidence lockers around the country, with no easy way to gain access. It also prompted local and federal politicians to draft bills that would force companies to comply with court orders and hand over any plain-text communications the government demands, though many of these efforts have since failed to gain much traction thanks to pressure from privacy advocates. While the case ended earlier this year, encryption still remains a hot topic — secure messaging apps like Signal, for example, are seeing a boost in users after the results of the election. The fiery Galaxy Note 7 Crushader/reddit Ah, the Galaxy Note 7. What is most disappointing about the Note 7 is that it received rave reviews from critics and tech reviewers alike — we gave it a 4 out of 5 and it was awarded Editors’ Choice. But then reports emerged about devices catching fire and causing harm, likely due to the battery. More: Samsung apologizes for the Note 7 recall in full-page print newspaper ad Samsung issued a recall, but unfortunately, it began shipping replacement units before it actually figured out the cause of the Note 7’s fiery combustion. When replacement devices had the same issue, it led to the death of the phone for good. Samsung issued a software update that disables any remaining Note 7 phones by eliminating their “ability to work as mobile devices.” Now, any mention of Samsung phones is likely to garner a joke about fire, and the fact that it’s one of the first phones ever to be banned on airplanes doesn’t help its case. The Korean giant has a lot to prove in 2017 with its upcoming Galaxy S8, and word has it Samsung is considering using batteries from its competitor, LG. RIP headphone jack Marley headphones jackMore Contrary to what many may believe, Apple did not eliminate the headphone jack first. Android handset makers like Chinese-company LeEco and the Lenovo-owned Motorola take the crown for that decision — but there’s no doubt that the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 sent waves through the audio industry. More: As the iPhone’s headphone jack dies, Apple wins and you lose While most lamented the loss of the headphone jack and the need to use dongles, it’s unlikely Bluetooth headset manufacturers are feeling all that bad. Expect to see Bluetooth earbuds everywhere in 2017, especially now that the AirPods are available for purchase and there are also rumors that Samsung may remove the headphone jack in its upcoming Galaxy S8. While the 3.5mm jack isn’t antiquated just yet, expect to see more phones with 3.5mm adapters in the box next year. Gawker’s demise Peter Theil at the Hy! Summit, Heisenberg Media Gawker, a gossip blog that launched in 2002, died this year. The site’s last post was in August, when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to the monetary judgment from the Hulk Hogan sex tape case. The website published a tape of the former wrestler having sex with his friend’s wife, and Hogan sent a cease-and-desist letter asking Gawker to remove the video. The site’s founder, Nick Denton, refused, citing the video’s news value fell under the purview of the First Amendment. The site also refused a judge’s order to take the video down. More: Gawker files for chapter 11 bankruptcy; deal in place to sell company to Ziff Davis Hogan then sued Gawker and eventually won the case, forcing Gawker to sell itself. Univision stepped up and bought the site for $135 million. Gawker’s archive of articles are still online, except for ones that were involved in litigation, and Gawker Media Group has now been changed to Gizmodo Media Group. Billionaire Peter Thiel, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, said he was bankrolling Hogan’s case as a personal vendetta against Gawker. One of Gawker’s now-defunct sister sites outed him as gay more than a decade ago. It’s no surprise Gawker’s demise comes from a published sex tape. The website was constantly embroiled in controversy and legal disputes for its content. No one wants to buy Twitter, RIP Vine vdovichenko/123RF Ever since it launched in 2006, Twitter has had a tough time turning a profit and it seemed like a company ripe for acquisition. While reports suggested Google, Salesforce, and Disney were interested in buying the social network, those companies have since lost interest and now it seems as though no one wants to buy Twitter. Twitter had two consecutive quarters of stagnant user growth, and while its third quarter beat estimates, it still isn’t turning a profit. The company also announced it was laying off 9 percent of its workforce at the time, or about 350 people. More: Twitter takeover roundup: Who’s interested in acquiring the social media giant? Twitter also said it was shutting down Vine, a social network that featured six-second videos curated by its users. Vine saw a mass exodus of its most popular users earlier in the year, which is likely what prompted Twitter to end the service. Twitter has since made somewhat of an about-face — it’s keeping Vine around, but it’s stripping the social network out of it. Vine will soon turn into Vine Camera in 2017, but it will no longer feature a feed of six-second videos from its users. It’ll be a tool anyone can use to make six-second videos, and that’s it. Vine as we know it is dead. Will Twitter find a buyer in 2017? Current rumors suggest Sprint’s parent company, Softbank, is eyeing the social network. No one wants a smartwatch, RIP Pebble Pebble Time RoundMore Jessica Lee Star/Digital Trends If smartwatches were supposed to become the next big thing, they failed. According to the International Data Corporation, total estimated shipments for smartwatches in the third quarter of 2016 were down a whopping 51 percent from last year — just 2.7 million units were shipped. While the IDC report didn’t include Apple Watch Series 2 sales, a separate IDC report wasn’t favorable for the new watch — Apple CEO Tim Cook responded vaguely and said the watch is “doing great.” Apple is still dominating the market, with Garmin and Samsung coming in behind. More: Kickstarter darling Pebble fades away as it folds into FitBit The lackluster sales show there isn’t much interest in smartwatches, and that’s likely reflective of the product itself — smartwatches just aren’t as useful as phones. Hardly any Android manufacturers released an Android Wear smartwatch this year either. But if there is one event that best sums up smartwatches in 2016 it’s the demise of Pebble. A few years ago, Pebble became a Kickstarter success story when it raised millions of dollars for its first Pebble smartwatch. But with declining sales and low demand in 2016, Fitbit announced it was acquiring the company and stripping its assets, meaning Pebble will no longer manufacture and sell devices. This year was not good for smartwatches, but there’s some hope for the platform in 2017. Google is set to release a major update to its Android Wear platform — version 2.0 — and rumors suggest we could even see smartwatches from the company itself. It’s likely that more Android manufacturers will follow suit. It will be interesting to see what Fitbit does with Pebble’s operating system, and we still expect new smartwatches from Apple and Samsung. The year of the hacker Yahoo is becoming synonymous with hacking — the internet company finally revealed two unprecedented hacks from 2013 and 2014. The 2014 hack saw a breach of 500 million user accounts, but the attack only came to light in 2016. We then found out that a second hack happened even earlier in 2013, and this one was much worse. The hack compromised up to 1 billion user accounts, making it one of the biggest data breaches in history. As a result, Verizon is feeling buyer’s remorse and is trying to lower the price in its deal to acquire Yahoo. More: One of the world’s biggest steelmakers may have lost industry secrets to hackers But that was hardly all that happened in 2016. A large-scale distributed denial-of-service attack against Dyn, an internet domain name system provider, caused access to major sites like Netflix, Twitter, Github, PayPal, and Spotify to flicker throughout the day. Worse yet, the issue stemmed from insecure household devices like CCTVs and DVRs due to malware called Mirai. If those events didn’t make you feel paranoid enough, we haven’t even mentioned the two biggest hacks — both of which affected the 2016 U.S. Election. The Democratic National Committee was hacked and nearly 20,000 emails were made public. It prompted the resignation of several high-level DNC members, including DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia was behind the attack, and was also involved in attempting to covertly influence the election to help President-Elect Donald Trump win by hacking Hillary Clinton’s emails, as well as some members of her staff. The agencies say it is possible that Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly involved. There are many more data breaches that occurred in 2016, and it’s likely only going to increase as the world becomes more and more connected. The modular craze that never happened This was supposed to be the year of the modular phone. It began strong with solid reviews of LG’s G5 — one of the first consumer phones to feature ‘mods,’ or removable/replaceable parts. Lenovo-owned Motorola followed up with an even better solution that didn’t require the phone to turn off with the Moto Z and Moto Z Force. But due to delays and lackluster interest, the G5’s modular capabilities seemed more like a gimmick. The Moto Z series seems like it is doing well for Lenovo and Motorola, but it has hardly reached mainstream levels of popularity. More: Google confirms the end of Project Ara, its attempt to build a modular smartphone Perhaps most disappointing was the death of Project Ara, a modular phone project from Google. The company showcased a prototype at its developer conference in May, and a developer unit was supposed to ship at the end of 2016. The first Ara phone was set to release in 2017. Unfortunately, the project was axed, reportedly because Google wanted to streamline its hardware efforts. Project Ara’s tech may end up being sold off to another company, but this was not what we expected 2016 to be like for modular phones. If Motorola can show that people are interested in mods, perhaps 2017 will be better for the concept. 2016: VR shows signs of growing pains HTC ViveMore Virtual reality is cool. There is no denying that headsets like the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift offer awe-inspiring, out-of-this-world experiences. But it seems as though VR has died down already, and has hardly attracted a mainstream audience. It’s still the early years for the platforms, but price may be preventing VR from achieving mainstream success. For example, at $800, the Vive isn’t something most people can easily afford. Mobile VR is gaining traction with the Gear VR from Samsung and Google’s Daydream View headset, but it’s too early to tell if either is a huge success. More: All the PlayStation VR games we’ve played so far, ranked Both of those mobile VR headsets require specific devices — a Samsung phone for the Gear VR, or a Google Pixel or Daydream-ready device for Daydream VR. The platforms will expand to more devices in 2017, which means more people will be able to try them out. Standalone headsets that don’t require a high-end phone, PlayStation, or expensive computer may make VR popular, but we’ll have to see what’s in store for 2017.

Here's How You Can Save It. If your app is on the chopping block and you're not seeing the download or review results you want, take heart: You might not be doomed. Q Manning Published 1:00 pm, Tuesday, December 27, 2016 Photo: TungCheung | Shutterstock.com Image 1of/1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Photo: TungCheung | Shutterstock.com Is Apple Going to Delete Your App? Here's How You Can Save It. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Until now, an outdated or half-baked app could be left sitting around, collecting a slow trickle of downloads even after its developers stopped pushing out updates. But that digital norm is about to change, as Apple recently announced its intention to clean up the App Store by evaluating and removing apps that fail to meet quality standards. If you’ve received notice from Apple that your app is at risk -- or if you just haven’t been diligent with your updates -- don’t fret! Now is the perfect opportunity to tackle those updates and stay relevant while taking advantage of some of the newest iOS technology. Roll out the updates. Apple wants its users to love using their phones, and that means the apps they download need to function at a high level. To ensure that experience, Apple is purging the apps that no longer function as intended since repeated iOS changes left them behind. Related: 5 Development Mistakes That Can Destroy Your Mobile App Updates keep apps running smoothly. If Apple releases iOS 10.2, you either have to update the functionality of your app or deal with the inevitable bugs that pop up as the OS outpaces the software. And, over time, that chasm grows. The difference between 10.1 and 10.2 might be small, but the gap between 8.2 and 10.2 is enormous. Most Popular 1 Pacific cold front brings risky weather to San Antonio area 2 Minor injured in Northwest San Antonio shooting 3 Body found in motel room, marks city’s first homicide of 2017 What does this mean for you and your development team? It means you now have an opportunity to reclaim some ground you might have given up ages ago with your app’s user base and functionality. That Instagram imitation from three years ago might have been hot at the time, but guess what? Instagram isn’t the same as it was in 2013, and neither are user expectations of how photo apps should operate. If you haven’t updated your app, not only is your product behind the times, but your understanding of current trends and user needs is also probably lacking. But if your app is on the chopping block and you’re not seeing the download or review results you want, you might not be doomed. In fact, you may just need to refresh your app -- and your understanding of the need it fills. Related: 15 Tips for Succeeding as an Independent App Developer Freshening up your app What new technologies have come out since you last overhauled your app? Could 3D Touch functionality make it more intuitive? What about Touch ID or a sticker pack to boost social capabilities? Fixing bugs is a big part of an update, but the real improvements come through added functionality. 1. Do ad hoc testing.  First things first. Open your app on the most recent device with the latest OS and put it through its paces. You won’t discover everything in one go, but it will give you a good idea of what your users experience. Companies such as Colligo depend on UX testing to iterate quickly and ensure they stay in touch with user needs. The more testing you perform, the more you'll begin to notice patterns in your software wherein the same features are the most prone to errors. In the early stages, though, there will be an element of randomness to where and how you focus your testing. Comparing how a certain feature operates on various devices, from a phone to a tablet to a browser, is a good place to start. 2. Dig deeper using Xcode.  Have development open the app in Apple's Xcode to look at specific error logs. This will allow you to find many root issues that ad hoc testing would not. This action will also help you get to the heart of any functionality problems and take advantage of crash reports you should be collecting. Xcode performs much of the work for you, categorizing and grouping every crash report users send to Apple and neatly laying out the common flaws that consistently cause your software to fail. 3. Check out the competition.  Once your app works properly, take a peek at your neighbor’s paper. What are competitors doing to keep their apps relevant? What features have they added, and how are they taking advantage of OS advancements? Be shameless about using whatever ideas you can gather to get your app noticed and downloaded. Learn from your competitors through their successes and mistakes so you don’t have to learn the hard way. Many app developers coordinate their updates around major marketing pushes, which can be your cue to dive into their apps and see for yourself what adjustments they're making to their offerings. You can also monitor competitors' placement on the "New and Updated" list in the App Store and time your own updates accordingly. Related: Getting Started With Small Business App Development Don’t let a good app fall by the wayside because of a few OS updates. Instead, be glad Apple has forced you to give your project some much-needed love and take the opportunity to retool and revitalize your approach. Your app -- and your devoted customers -- will thank you for it. Related: Is Apple Going to Delete Your App? Here's How You Can Save It.

Using a mix of phone and app activations, Flurry discovered that Apple saw more than double the number of smartphone activations as Samsung, and a noticeable increase in phablet device activations. Flurry Analytics, the late-Steve Jobs’ favorite analytics company, annually takes a look at the most gifted smartphones during the holiday seasons. This year, with Christmas and Hanukkah lined up, Flurry took a look at smartphone, tablet, and app activations that happened from the week leading up to Christmas Day and to the start of Hanukkah. The group discovered that Apple led with 44% of new device activations, with Samsung as the runner-up at 21%. Flurry notes that Samsung is “slowly growing in popularity throughout the holiday season, up 1% from last year“, but Apple continues to remain in the lead. The remaining top activations paint an interesting picture as well: Huawei comes in 3rd at 3%, and then LG, Amazon, Oppo, Xiaomi, and Motorola all following with 2%. Google’s Pixel is nowhere to be seen on the chart, most likely because they only have two major flagship devices this holiday season: the Pixel and Pixel XL. Flurry’s report also mentions that the sales of phablets (indicating 5 to 6.9 inch devices) are eating away at medium-sized device activations. During the holidays, phablet activations increased up to 37% from 27% the year prior. This year also presents Apple with its first 14 week quarter since FQ1 2012. Robert Paul Leitao of the Braeburn Group explains to Philip Elmer-DeWitt: Ordinarily Apple’s fiscal quarters are exactly 13 weeks in length and always end on a Saturday. Because 365 days are not wholly divisible by 7, there’s a reminder day each year (2 days in a leap year). To realign the company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, every 5 or 6 years (depending on the number of leap days in the multi-year period) Apple adds a 14th week to its first fiscal quarter. The last time this occurred was FQ1 2012 (the December-ending calendar quarter of 2011). This extra week presents Apple with another chunk of time to increase sales. Maynard Um, Wells Fargo analyst, estimates Apple could sell an extra 3 million iPhones, and RBC’s Amit Daryanani guests between 5 and 6 million.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search A dual-cam 5″ iPhone would be the perfect 2017 tweener Chris Davies - Dec 27, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit A third iPhone 8 that cherry-picks the best of the two current models could give Apple a new sweet-spot – and a 2017 sales hit. Reports that the Cupertino firm will have not two but three new iPhones in refresh next year broke this week, with a 5-inch screen tipped to slot in-between the 4.7- and 5.5-inch sizes that have been part of the range since the iPhone 6. While a 5-inch iPhone might sound like a compromise, in fact it could end up being Apple’s new mass-market pleaser. According to the leaks, while the third iPhone will sit in the middle spot in screen size, it’ll borrow one of its bigger brother’s most appealing features. The dual-camera system which allows the iPhone 7 Plus to deliver lossless optical zooming, among other things, will apparently be carried down to the smaller handset. Apple does have a track record of more ambitious tech trickling down to smaller devices. After all, this year the iPhone 7 gained the optical image stabilization that was previously limited to the Plus-sized variants. Still, there’s a limit to just what you can physically pack into a space, even with the cutting-edge of component miniaturization working with you: just to fit the dual-cameras in, the 5-inch iPhone is said to have to rotate the assembly 90-degrees, for instance. I’m one of the people who made the switch from 4.7-inch iPhone to 5.5-inch “Plus” when the iPhone 7 launched. Previously, the advantages of features like optical image stabilization were always outweighed by its physical size. While a bigger battery and OIS for video were nice, the hand-friendly scale of the smaller iPhone nonetheless won out. It changed with the arrival of dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus, though. Suddenly, there was a truly compelling reason for me to switch up: as I wrote at the time, not only was I surprised at how much I used the lossless zoom, but the promise of more computational photography tricks – like the Portrait mode with its faux-bokeh effect – left me feeling I’d miss out if I went for the regular iPhone 7. In the months since, I’ve mostly become used to the physically bigger device. That’s not to say there aren’t lingering compromises. I’m a big fan of Mophie’s Juice Pack batteries, not least because of their wireless charging abilities, but slotting an iPhone 7 Plus into the newest battery case leaves me with something that’s just too unwieldy to be practical. The Plus spoils the lines of a suit jacket (on the admittedly fairly rare times I wear one) more noticeably than its smaller sibling; it can play havoc with skinny jeans. Altogether, I’m a strong candidate for backtracking on size somewhat. Were there a “tweener” device in the mid-point between 4.7- and 5.5-inches, it’s something I suspect I’d go for, and I doubt I’m alone. Many of the people I’ve spoken to since the iPhone 7’s launch have either talked enviously of the 7 Plus’ camera abilities but refused to step up to so large a device, or conversely have embraced the Plus’ camera but still find its bulk off-putting. Whether that device is called the iPhone 8, as one set of rumors would have it, or the iPhone 7s, as another batch of insiders claim, doesn’t really matter. That’s not to say my attention wasn’t caught by chatter of native wireless charging recently, mind. NOW READ: An OLED iPhone 8 depends on one big gamble Apple’s long-time strategy of just a handful of size options has always stood in marked contrast to Android, where a wide array of screen dimensions is more common. While a third iPhone size – or, if you consider the iPhone SE, a fourth – in the line-up might at first glance seem to dilute that frugality, it could well encourage trade-ups from those who would usually opt for a smaller handset while coveting big-phone features. That wouldn’t hurt Apple’s bottom line, and it would satisfy plenty of iOS fans too.

Twitter apparently no longer allows sharing between the two social media platforms, while Apple rejected the GAB IOS app on the grounds that it includes user-posted pornographic content. GAB CEO Andrew Torba, a.k.a. the GabFather, is appealing this decision. “The double standards of Silicon Valley are on full display with this app store rejection from Apple. Apps like Tumblr, Reddit, and Twitter are flooded with pornographic content and allowed to remain on the App store,” he explained in an email to Breitbart Tech. During the election season, Twitter suspended several users on the political right for alleged hate speech, but seldom took any action for similar behavior on the left. It also was regularly accused of shadow-banning users and hashtags unfavorable to Hillary Clinton. Also, back in August, Apple CEO Tim Cook hosted a big-ticket fundraiser for Hillary Clinton. Gab’s issues with “Big Social” are hardly a surprise since it’s no particular secret that Silicon Valley tilts left. You may recall that earlier this year, Facebook found itself engulfed in a controversy over suppressing conservative-oriented stories from its trending news section, which led to a change in curation procedures. It also prompted Torba to decide to develop Gab in the first place. Moreover, in another questionable decision, in its stated effort to weed out “fake news,” Facebook selected four or five left-wing organizations including Politifact, as fact-checkers. Parenthetically, allegations also emerged during the campaign that Google was suppressing information unfavorable to Hillary Clinton. In a separate interview with Breitbart Tech, Torba — a Trump supporter who was kicked out of a Silicon Valley start-up organization after a heated online dispute with other members — noted that his platform won’t engage in politically correct suppression of free speech. “We believe that the only valid form of censorship is self-censorship, an individual’s freedom to opt-out. Gab empowers users to self-censor and remove unwanted followers, words, phrases, and topics they don’t want to see in their feeds to help stop and prevent different forms harassment. However, we do take steps to protect ourselves and our users from illegal activity.” Still a work in progress, the rapidly growing Gab.ai, which allows a 300-character message rather than Twitter’s 140, is accepting new users, but there is a bit of a waiting list. Hopefully, Gab will begin to attract a wider audience across the political spectrum.

Vaughan is known for his incredible storytelling, mixing the real world with fantasy, science fictionm, and pure magic. His latest series, Paper Girls, is no exception to his previous works. Many say that Paper Girls is like Stranger Things with a female cast, and that may be accurate, but Paper Girls may also be even better than the hit Netflix show. For starters, Paper Girls doesn’t stop with nods to the ’80s through music, art and props. The entire text and art by Cliff Chiang emulates the time period, and while there’s some of that in Stranger Things, it feels even more grounded in Paper Girls. Paper Girls is also full of even weirder scenarios and monsters. Sure, the Demogorgon and the Upside Down were strange, but pterodactyl monsters, time-travelers, aliens, mutants… Here are The 15 Best Moments In Paper Girls to demonstrate just how incredible this comic is. 15. Nods To The ’80s Reading Paper Girls is a bit like stepping into an A-ha video. There’s enough ’80s hair and clothing to make a Molly Ringwald movie, references to everything from Depeche Mode to The Far Side, and even a campaign sign that reads Bush ’88 (not to be confused with Bush ’00 or ’04). Like crowd-favorite iconic ’80s movies such as Stand by Me and The Goonies, there’s also the camaraderie of a group of four kids, plenty of foul language and adventure, as well as some great bikes. The difference, much to the delight of plenty of comic readers, is that all of these characters are female. There aren’t many pieces of media that feature an all-girls coming-of-age group. The film Now and Then starring Christina Ricci and Thora Birch comes to mind, but even that isn’t quite as enjoyable as Paper Girls (although it comes close). Women who grew up in the ’80s now have a cool comic that they can relate to while everyone else can get a peek at what it was like to be a paper girl in that time period. 14. The Moment When Apple Shows Up As much as we love the classic ’80s theme in Paper Girls, Vaughan ensures that we know that the entire comic may not take place in that time. Our first major clue comes in the form of none other than the Apple logo! The computer of the future features this symbol, which perplexes the girls. When it is suggested by Erin that the device might be a tiny computer, KJ scoffs, “How would you fit a whole computer into something the size of a Klondike Bar?” Erin sagely and prophetically suggests that since computers used to be enormous, maybe they could also be tiny. This scene links the girls to the modern world, giving readers a clue about time travel being involved in the plot while simultaneously delivering a laugh. Readers of the series know that the girls have many more futuristic finds in store, but this is the moment when we see that, despite how strange the opposition forces may seem, at least some of them are likely still from our own world. 13. The Christa McAuliffe Angel Fans often enjoy seeing Easter eggs of Vaughan’s work from previous comics in his current work and Paper Girls has a few. One of the most noticeable instances in the first compilation is the angel of Christa McAuliffe, who comes to speak to Erin in a dream. Her astronaut helmet brings to mind the imagery of Saga’s Prince Robot and his “people,” for lack of a better word, especially when the front reflects terrifying imagery to Erin before McAuliffe pierces her in the face, transforming into a devil-like creature after Erin utters a swear word. McAuliffe was, of course, the teacher who was tragically killed in the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986. Mentioning her gives the story a fuller presence in the ’80s, since it occurred just prior to the Paper Girls timeline, given that Bush I ran for president in 1988. It is likely that McAuliffe is a hero of Erin’s, but she also symbolizes the dangers of exploration that Erin is about to experience in her own journey. Tragedy and death could very well play a part in it, as any Vaughan reader knows to be wary. 12. The Tree Of Knowledge Scene The interesting thing about the McAuliffe “Tree of Knowledge” scene (aside from its terror-inducing imagery) is that the McAuliffe-like creature snarls, “We warned you… Never eat from the tree of knowledge.” Not only does this quote and its art foreshadow the entire comic, as Erin and her new friends attempt to make sense of the chaos erupting around them, but it also reverses the role of demon and god, implying that the Biblical God who warned humans to avoid the apples at all costs was, in fact, this monstrous beast. Using the popular Labyrinth theme of “things are not always what they seem in this place,” Vaughan furthers the theme of the book: those who appear to be trustworthy are not and vice versa. Some of the very time-travelers who seem to pose a threat, in fact, are responsible for saving Erin’s life and sacrificing their own in the process. 11. The Paper Girl Meet-Cute In the scene where Erin first meets the other girls in the story, not only is Mac established as a badass character fans are sure to love, but the scene itself is very reminiscent of Stand by Me. Mac uses obscene language to take on the older boys, as do the rest of the girls between one another, which gives the time period even more of an authentic feel, bringing to mind a time when Ace Merrill promised he’d make Gordie Lachance pay for standing up to him big time. The care with which the scenes and especially the dialogue is written comes back full circle to Vaughan. He says, “I like writing female characters. I remember when I was doing Runaways at Marvel, that was a teen book that had more females than males in it. At the time, it was the subject of great controversy as we were doing it…Usually, there’s a token female or two, but to have a team be predominantly of women, the fact that it was a bit of a conversation to have even that. Now… here’s a great opportunity to do what I always wanted to do, just a group of females and not have to defend it or explain it, and just get to write them.” 10. It Came From The Basement When the girls find the monstrous-looking machine in the basement of an unfinished house, Erin points out that it looks a lot like “the old Apollo capsule,” which further highlights her interest in space for the reader. Humanoid features, including what appears to be a brain, can be seen in the machine, if it is even a machine at all. The thing also looks a bit like a Dalek, but it also featured a skin-like cloth, making readers whether it’s alive. Readers are well aware of Vaughan’s ability to meld man and machine, so this would not be a first if the thing really is some kind of life form. His Ex Machina comics focus on a man with the power to “talk to” machines, among other things, and he blends robots with humans in his Saga series. Of course, the outer-galactic moment that occurs when Tiffany, KJ, Mac, and Erin get back outside is worth mentioning here as well. When KJ fiddles with the machine, it begins to buzz before emitting a blinding light that acts as an X-ray on the girls. It is clear that something has changed in their community as they emerge from the house and see the universe up closer than they ever have before. As many weird things have occurred within the first few pages, this is the moment when we know not all is right with the world as they know it. 9. Hit A Girl! Mack proves her mettle in the panel where she takes on the “alien” creature. KJ attempts to grab Tiff’s beloved walkie-talkie back from the mysterious interlopers only to be casually backhanded for her trouble. Mack is outraged over the treatment of her friend, gritting her teeth and seething, “Son of a bitch!” twice before reaching for the bad guy. Crying, “Hit a girl!” she follows her talk with her walk, yanking on the thief only to pull back his face cover to reveal a human-like creature with strange facial hardware. The creature attempts to strangle Mack but KJ comes back to intervene, whacking it on the head with her hockey stick. Mack suffers some weird aftereffects from the alien’s touch, including what seems like temporary face-melting and different speech patterns, but in all, the girls have won a greater battle than the threat of the teen boys earlier in the book. 8. A Plethora Of Villainous Possiblity Monsters, aliens, a disease (“like Rocky Dennis in Mask!“), nuclear mutants, demons… the girls begin postulating about what the villainous creatures could be and it reminds us of Vaughan’s Y: The Last Man, in which we never really found out what caused the death of man, but were given several options. Explanations of mystical, biological and nefarious natures were all provided but Vaughan himself has stated that even he is not sure, though he has his preference, and that he prefers for readers to come to their own conclusions about the cause of the near-extinction of men. Will Paper Girls have a similar conclusion? In book one, it seems as if the culprits of this crazy day (yes, it’s still only been a single day, at least to our knowledge) are evolved humans from a distant future that includes a herd of pterodactyls and a leader who looks like a cross between Jerry Garcia and Santa Clause. Vaughan still has much in store for readers so it could be too early to tell. 7. Those Crazy Pterodactyl Monsters Other than the Marvel Savage Lands, you don’t see pterodactyls in comics very often. Sauron is probably the most famous example. The pterodactyls (or whatever they are) in Paper Girls are the first real sign that maybe we aren’t dealing with terrorists or even aliens, but actual monsters. The first time we see one of the creatures is in the second issue when one of the antagonists is seen running with a bag under his or her arm. The next thing we know, there’s a giant monster foot in the panel as the humanoid looks up. Next his shadow is seen in the shadow of the beak of the creature before blood splatter fills the next panel. The page presents more questions than answers, since not only is there suddenly a monster resembling a dinosaur on the scene, but also a futuristic gloved hand that reaches down for Tiff’s walkie-talkie. Later, when the sky is full of the creatures, it feels as if the entire world has at least partly traveled back in time. It’s also one of the scenes that brings a Doctor Who feel to the book, making readers wonder if Vaughan drew any inspiration from the show. 6. The Shot Heard Around Mac’s House Kids irresponsibly handling a gun is another coming-of-age trope that we’ve witnessed in films like Stand by Me, and in Paper Girls the situation proves to be much more dangerous. This time, it is an adult who introduces the weapon. Mac’s pessimistic stepmother, who the girls find drinking, smoking and lamenting the end of the world, attempts to kill herself with it. Mac wrestles the gun away from her, telling her that she loves her, and as the gun goes off, readers are left with a crushing cliffhanger at the end of the issue. In issue #3, it is revealed that Mac’s stepmother is safe. It was Erin who was shot. The scene features a surreal moment when everyone is so relieved that Mac’s mom isn’t dead that they don’t even notice Erin bleeding. The comic pans to her and she weakly says, “It’s a miracle,” while she bleeds. The girls then embark on another beloved tween-teen theme in coming-of-age stories: attempting to drive Erin to the hospital themselves. 5. An Effed Up Time After everything the Paper Girls have been through already, it seems as if their world is as insane as it gets. From terrorist/cyborg/alien beings to pterodactyls, weird moments of outer-space nearness to the vanishing of all people except for themselves, it would seem that their world cannot get any weirder. When the humanoids reveal themselves to be teenagers, the girls are surprised to say the least, but readers have to chuckle when, while traipsing through the sewer, they inform the girls that the girls themselves are the ones from “an effed up time“! One of the teenagers, Heck, says that his boyfriend was murdered by one of the “old timers.” This likely refers to the death of the teen we witnessed in issue #2 with the first appearance of a pterodactyl. Mac, who has expressed several off-color remarks already, says, “Eww.” KJ admonishes her friend but Heck replies, “Don’t worry about it. You guys are from an effed-up time,” which readers already know from having lived in it or knowing the history of attitudes toward the LGBT community in general. 4. Tiff’s Near Death Experience While traveling with the two time-traveling teens in the sewers, the girls meet yet another monster. This enormous, green creature sort of makes us think of the aliens in the tween film Explorers starring Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix. Those aliens were teenagers as well. This alien (or monster), however, is a round, neon green, almost glowing creature with multiple appendages that each feature a cubed eyeball, and it is out for blood from the girls and their companions. If that isn’t weird enough, Tiffany almost dies in the scene and her near death experience is a flashback with which many people can relate. She sees herself playing the NES Nintendo game Arkanoid for hours and hours on end, ignoring Christmas presents, Thanksgiving meals, and other excitement in lieu of the game. Some cells even depict her on the phone or with longer hair to demonstrate how much time she has spent on the game. The danger of Tiff’s situation, the fragility of her life, is cut with the irony of how much of that life has been spent in front of a game system– something that many of us understand well. 3. Future Erin’s Arrival It’s not every day that you meet the future version of yourself on the street, but that’s exactly what happened to Erin at the end of the first Paper Girls book. A car pulls up and the girls are so relieved to see an adult from their time that they approach and beg for help. Erin introduces herself only to gape at the woman who emerges from the car, who asks, “Is this a joke? My name is Erin Tiang.” This version of Erin looks like she comes from modern day America. She’s wearing a contemporary shirt with modern jeans and shoes, and her stylish haircut is definitely not an ’80s throwback, but what really gives her presence away are the earbuds that she wears, which are attached to her cell phone in her pocket. Of course this is where Vaughan leaves the series until the next installment, leaving fans to ponder the future of the girls (quite literally) in the series. 2. Those Bugs! The nanogenes from Doctor Who had to be running through artist Cliff Chiang’s mind when he made Vaughan’s futuristic medical bugs come to life. When Heck and Naldo take Erin to their “Whenhouse” of the future (or wherever they go) to save her life, they treat her with something that seems to stem from medieval healing methods rather than futuristic ones: bugs. Heck calls the bugs “iNsecs,” and says they were difficult to boost when Erin warns she is going to toss her cookies all over them. He also refers to them as junk. The bugs take over on Erin’s gunshot wound, healing it like a bunch of futuristic leeches. This scene gave us a feverish Erin in the throes of more weird dreams. This time, they featured Erin as a young child telling her father that she didn’t realize that grownups were scared, too. His face melts off as he cries and admits that grownups are terrified before she wakes up to see that Heck and Naldo are dying. 1. The Human Collection While the Paper Girls have no idea where their town disappeared to, readers find out when we see the inside of the Grand Father’s home. Grand Father was previously introduced when one of the pterodactyl-riding warriors called to report the death of her comrade, but it is in Paper Girls issue #5 that we see him walk through a hall of pink chambers that house the people of the town. Readers can recognize the teen girl dressed as a cat who previously vanished. Adults, children, and even toddlers can be seen in the chambers, and again the scene, like most other revealing moments, gives readers more questions than answers. Readers now understand that the people of Earth may not be dead, but why they are captured in cryogenic-like containers, who Grand Father and his soldiers are, and what exactly is happening in the first place all remain a to-be-continued mystery. — What’s your favorite moment from Paper Girls?

But, once you open up the box, it can be hard to know what to look for outside of the basic setup. That’s why we’re here to help. For these tips, we’re focusing on instructions for the Apple Watch and for Fitbit devices — the two most popular wearables makers in the United States — although the suggestions fit most types of wearables. Here are three things to think about as you set up your shiny new wearable device. Pick a side. I realize this sounds pretty basic, but choosing a wrist can be important for fitness trackers such as Fitbit because your dominant hand tends to move a lot more throughout the day than your non-dominant hand. That, in turn, can affect the way trackers actually log your movement. On Fitbit, for example, you can tell it if you’re wearing the device on your more active hand or not in the app that links with your new tracker. On the Apple Watch, during setup you can tell it which wrist you want to wear it on (right or left) and which side you want the digital crown — Apple’s little controller wheel — to face. That should take care of everyone’s preferences for watch orientation. If you want to change this for any reason, you can do so through the Watch app on your phone — just hit “My Watch” and then go to “General” settings. “Watch Orientation” should be an option for you. To share or not to share? Many of the features in smartwatches and other wearables have a lot of sharing functions — so you can share your fitness progress throughout the day, or compete with friends. For some people, this is part of the point of getting a wearable. But, for others, it may be a tracking step too far. Get familiar with your privacy settings. For Fitbit users, you can find your privacy settings by heading to your web-based dashboard, and diving into the settings menu. From there, you can control who can see your daily step counts, photos, location and other things that Fitbit tracks. By default, some things — sleep patterns, your age, your weight, photos — can only be viewed by you, but some things are also viewable by everyone, such as your average daily step count. Adjust as you see fit. On the Apple Watch, you can also share your activity for the day, but that is not set up by default. Where privacy can get tricky with the Apple Watch is in displaying notifications on your wrist. If you don’t want anyone who glances at your wrist to be able to read the start of your text messages, there is a setting that will let you limit what is shown on the watch face. Head to the Watch app on your phone and hit the “Notifications” menu. If you switch on “Notifications Privacy,” you’ll have to tap to see messages and other notification details. It can be a little less convenient, but it could also save you some embarrassment in a meeting. Mind your notifications. One thing that can quickly kill the joy of a wearable device is getting too many notifications. It’s great to see who’s calling or texting, but it can be pretty annoying to be expecting a message and then get a tap on the wrist to let you know that an article about a celebrity you don’t recognize is trending on Twitter. For the Apple Watch, you can set the watch to mirror all your phone’s notifications, but that can become overwhelming quickly. A better approach is to head into the Watch app and find your “Notifications” section. Scroll down through all the apps to choose what you want to see on your wrist and what you don’t. Keep in mind that you may have to head back here as you install new apps, to set those notifications as you like them as well. On Fitbit devices, notifications vary by the type of device you own, but can be controlled through the Fitbit app by heading to the “Account” section and then tapping on “Notifications.” On most models, you can choose whether you want to be notified about calls, texts and calendar events. On the Blaze, one of Fitbit’s more advanced models, you can also link your email account, as well as some messaging programs such as WhatsApp. For all models, keep in mind that to receive notifications on your wrist, you will also have to turn them on for your phone.

July 2016 mockups showing iPhone 7 and two variations of iPhone 7 Plus As we reach the end of the year, it's worth a look back at some of the more notable and accurate rumors and leaks from 2016 to see how the sometimes long and winding road of rumors led to the product launches we eventually saw. iPhone 7 As always, the iPhone rumor cycle starts early, although this year seemed to have a smaller than usual number of part leaks beyond the usual casing leaks, most of which were physical mockups based on circulating design specs. The most controversial change in the iPhone 7 was the removal of the headphone jack, a rumor that first surfaced in November 2015 courtesy of Mac Otakara. As the calendar flipped over to 2016, additional sources came out in support of the claim, although many observers remained skeptical even as additional rumors and case leaks poured in throughout the first half of the year. One of the other key changes in the iPhone 7 is the dual rear camera found on the larger iPhone 7 Plus model, and KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo was the first to report that rumor back in January. At the time, it wasn't clear if the dual camera modules would be available in sufficient supplies to be included on all iPhone 7 Plus models, so Apple also protoypted a single-camera iPhone 7 Plus, but the company was indeed able to offer the dual cameras across the board on the iPhone 7 Plus. March 2016 leak of iPhone 7 Plus dual rear camera module By March, we started seeing our first part leaks in the form of the dual camera for the iPhone 7 Plus and an apparent mockup of the iPhone 7 Plus rear shell, showing the dual camera and an integrated camera bump. Leaked iPhone 7 Plus shell mockup from March 2016 That rear shell leak also depicted three dots near the bottom of the case, leading to speculation about an iPad Pro-like Smart Connector. Rumors about an iPhone Smart Connector persisted for months afterward, but became quieter as we got closer to launch, and it's unclear whether this rumor was unfounded from the very beginning or if it's something Apple toyed with but ultimately decided against including. AirPods Rumors about Apple's AirPods wireless earphones date back to October 2015, when we discovered a trademark application for the name that bore the hallmarks of being registered by an Apple shell company. As rumors of Apple removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 increased, speculation about potential wireless earphones from Apple followed suit, including a specific claim in January that Apple was working on premium wireless earphones to be sold alongside the iPhone 7. September 2015 trademark application that first revealed the "AirPods" name By July, we had increasing confidence that Apple was indeed behind efforts to trademark the "AirPods" name, and soon after we began hearing about Apple's custom Bluetooth chip that would arrive in the AirPods and new Beats headphones in the form of the W1 chip. Heading into Apple's September iPhone 7 event, Apple began registering for product certifications for the AirPods, while trademark investigation further confirmed Apple's efforts to protect the AirPods name, along with other terms such as AirPod Case. iPhone SE Apple's iPhone SE debuted in March, and by the time the calendar flipped over to 2016 the rumor mill was in full swing on this device after several years of rumors about a new 4-inch iPhone to satisfy more budget-minded customers and those unhappy with Apple's 2014 move to larger devices with the iPhone 6. Those rumors picked up in earnest with a December 2014 report claiming Apple was aiming for a late 2015 launch of the new 4-inch phone. The biggest question about the iPhone SE that wasn't resolved until relatively close to its launch was just what the device would look like, with rumors split between an iPhone 5s-like design and a more iPhone 6-like design with rounded edges. February 2016 drawing showing an iPhone SE design based on iPhone 5s but with a bit of iPhone 6-style rounding Ultimately, the iPhone SE turned out to be essentially identical to the iPhone 5 and 5s in terms of design, but with internal specs on par with the iPhone 6s in many respects. One of the other details about the iPhone SE that remained unclear heading into 2016 was what its name would be, with the official name surfacing from 9to5Mac just under a month before the device's unveiling. Rumors from January had suggested the device could carry an "iPhone 5se" or iPhone 5e" name, while earlier rumors had pointed toward "iPhone 6c" as a possible name, a moniker which had previously been attached to a rumored colorful budget version of the iPhone 6. 9.7-Inch iPad Pro Given that the iPad Air 2 had debuted in late 2014, rumors of an "iPad Air 3" naturally ramped up heading into late 2015 and the launch of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. January 2016 drawing showing four speakers and rear flash on 9.7-inch iPad Pro As we continued to wait for a new 9.7-inch iPad into 2016, rumors began hinting at a more iPad Pro-like device, with rumors starting to point toward a four-speaker setup and rear camera flash in January and ultimately including a Smart Connector and Apple Pencil support and even the same "iPad Pro" name. Apple Watch Early rumors about the second-generation Apple Watch suggested it could include a significant upgrade such as a camera, GPS, and cellular connectivity, but as we moved into early 2016, rumors began indicating we'd actually be seeing an update focused on internal upgrades with a launch in late 2016. By August, the specs for the Apple Watch Series 2 were pretty well nailed down, including GPS, a barometer, better waterproofing, and a larger battery, but not cellular connectivity. August 2016 photos of Apple Watch Series 2 battery, 35% larger than original generation One of the more intriguing rumors came in early August and addressed the possibility of Apple selling "upgraded" Apple Watch 1 models alongside the second-generation models. There was considerable skepticism about the rumor, as it was unclear why Apple would not just sell price-reduced original models alongside the Apple Watch 2, but the rumor indeed proved to be true, with Apple offering Series 2 models alongside new Series 1 models that were nearly identical to the first-generation models but with a faster processor to address performance issues. MacBook Pro Rumors of redesigned MacBook Pro models have circulated for quite some time, although some of the early rumors out of Apple's supply chain either confused the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air or were ambiguous about which line they were addressing, which made for some uncertainty in the early months of the rumor cycle. One of the most widely covered early rumors actually came in November 2015, when it was reported Apple was working on new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with "fully redesigned" internal components. In hindsight, it seems clear this rumor referred to the MacBook Pro, and this became clearer in subsequent months as additional rumors surfaced. The "new 13-inch and 15-inch" notebook rumor appeared again in March, and this time the machines were simply referred to as "MacBooks" and said to be thinner than the existing MacBook Air. Again there was confusion about which notebook line this rumor referred to, but it does once again appear to have been referring to the MacBook Pro, which is indeed thinner than the thickest portion of the MacBook Air. The rumor suggested the new notebooks could arrive in the June or July timeframe, hinting at a potential introduction at WWDC in early June, but we had to wait several more months before we finally did see the new MacBook Pro in October. By late May we saw our first rumor about the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar, with reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately describing the Touch Bar, Touch ID, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, a new "thin and light" design, and a fourth quarter launch. His description of a new 13-inch MacBook was confusing, however, and in retrospect it appears he was talking about the non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro that also appeared in October. May 2016 of MacBook Pro top case with space for Touch Bar Just days after Kuo's report, the first (and only) true part leak for the MacBook Pro we saw appeared when photos of a top case from the 13-inch model leaked out of Apple's supply chain. The photos clearly showed blank space replacing the traditional row of function keys, giving some strong support to rumors of the OLED Touch Bar that was indeed included on the new models. The photos also showed the larger trackpad on the new MacBook Pro, while side views showed the machine's four USB-C ports and a headphone jack. macOS 10.12.1 graphic from Apple leaked the Touch Bar and Touch ID Subsequent rumors about the MacBook Pro generally reaffirmed what we'd already heard, with questions continuing to circulate about timing until Apple officially announced its October media event. In a bit of a surprise, Apple ended up spoiling its own unveiling a bit by including information on keyboard layouts with function keys, Apple Pay and Touch ID, along with graphics showing the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar, in the macOS 10.12.1 update that was released several days prior to the event. MacBook In early 2016, DigiTimes indicated Apple was planning to begin production on updated MacBook models with Skylake processors around March or April, which seemed reasonable given it would mark an approximately one-year interval since the machine was initially introduced. March 2016 OS X reference to 12" MacBook (Early 2016) In late March, it was discovered that Apple had inadvertently leaked its own secrets by including references to an "Early 2016" MacBook within OS X, suggesting a launch before the end of April. Apple followed through with a launch of updated MacBooks in late April. MacBook Air Rumors on the MacBook Air were quite sparse in 2016, and in fact Apple did not update the machine other than quietly bumping the standard RAM to 8 GB on the 13-inch models in April and then discontinuing the 11-inch models in October. The only persistent rumor for the MacBook Air was a shift to USB-C that may have resulted from confusion with the MacBook Pro. Even as the MacBook Pro detail began to firm up, however, reports of USB-C MacBook Air models continued, with mainstream media picking them up by August and other sources continuing to mention them almost until Apple's October event. It now seems apparent, however, that Apple has no plans for significant MacBook Air updates, and the machine will likely be phased out as Apple consolidates its notebook lineup into the MacBook Pro and MacBook. iMac Several rumors in the latter part of 2016 indicated Apple is working on new iMacs with USB-C and AMD graphics chips. Bloomberg had indicated the updated iMacs were part of a wave of new Macs, some of which could launch "as soon as October," but the MacBook Pro was the only Mac to see an update in that timeframe. Just ahead of Apple's October media event, Ming-Chi Kuo reported that the new iMacs won't be ready until the first half of 2017, a claim echoed by Bloomberg in late December. Displays An August report from Bloomberg claimed Apple was working with LG on a new 5K external monitor, some two months after Apple discontinued the Apple Thunderbolt Display and said it was getting out of the display business. That turned out to be correct, with Apple and LG introducing the new LG-branded 5K display (and a smaller 4K sibling) at Apple's MacBook Pro event in October, and the new display began shipping just before the end of the year. LG's UltraFine 5K displays alongside new MacBook Pro Ming-Chi Kuo addressed the topic of a new "Cinema Display" from Apple ahead of the October media event, indicating the display would likely ship in the first half of 2017 as the "shipping schedule [was] not imminent," but it is unclear whether he was referring to the LG 5K display that just barely began shipping before the new year. Wrap-up Despite some confusion and conflicting rumors, the rumor mill was fairly accurate at predicting Apple's product plans for 2016. As usual, some very early rumors on the various products turned out to be correct, but it took time for additional reports to corroborate the claims and increase confidence in them. Among the most notable uncertainties were details on the iPhone SE, which varied significantly between iPhone 5s-like and iPhone 6 or 6s-like characteristics both internally and externally. Part of the uncertainty may have arisen from an extended development timeline that initially pointed toward a 2015 release but as it was pushed into 2016 Apple may have opted to increase the hardware capabilities of the device. With Apple's product launches done for 2016 and the calendar turning to 2017 this coming weekend, attention will soon turn toward a new batch of rumors as consumers look forward to the next iPhone, new iPads, more Mac updates, and perhaps some additional surprises.

Thanks MR team! I've been coming here since 2001 and your tireless efforts have not only been a part of my daily routine, but also greatly appreciated. Thank you all for the energy, dedication, commitment and passion you exhaust to ensure such a vibrant community has a place to congregate. That said, my only ask is of our vibrant community: let's actively work to treat each other with a little more kindness and dignity in 2017. One of the reasons I've been drawn to this community is because we share higher-than-normal standards for, and expectations of (amongst other things), the way software, hardware and technology interface with our world. Yet we don't appear to have any standards when it comes to how we treat each other in this forum (or elsewhere). In the 15 years I've been an active member here, this past year was about as vile as I can recall. The destructive negativity and pointless snark was paramount. Embarrassing even. And I think we're better than that. Actionable feedback is a critical component of any healthy environment and is the only way meaningful improvement/innovation exist. But actionable feedback doesn't stop at just complaining. Complaining is easy. It's lazy. It's how children react to frustration or confusion (I see it daily with my 2 & 6 year olds). Complaining does little to improve anything. But actionable feedback pairs criticism with solution. It's what separates the champs from the chumps. And it's what I expect of a community that expects so much of others. Here's to a happier, healthier 2017! Cheers!

Rating: 2 Votes nsimpson94 6 days ago at 07:06 pm Fun recap. Thanks MR team! I've been coming here since 2001 and your tireless efforts have not only been a part of my daily routine, but also greatly appreciated. Thank you all for the energy, dedication, commitment and passion you exhaust to ensure such a vibrant community has a place to congregate. That said, my only ask is of our vibrant community: let's actively work to treat each other with a little more kindness and dignity in 2017. One of the reasons I've been drawn to this community is because we share higher-than-normal standards for, and expectations of (amongst other things), the way software, hardware and technology interface with our world. Yet we don't appear to have any standards when it comes to how we treat each other in this forum (or elsewhere). In the 15 years I've been an active member here, this past year was about as vile as I can recall. The destructive negativity and pointless snark was paramount. Embarrassing even. And I think we're better than that. Actionable feedback is a critical component of any healthy environment and is the only way meaningful improvement/innovation exist. But actionable feedback doesn't stop at just complaining. Complaining is easy. It's lazy. It's how children react to frustration or confusion (I see it daily with my 2 & 6 year olds). Complaining does little to improve anything. But actionable feedback pairs criticism with solution. It's what separates the champs from the chumps. And it's what I expect of a community that expects so much of others. Here's to a happier, healthier 2017! Cheers! Beautifully said and I further your comments!

Before you go, we thought you'd like these... READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Ben Gilbert Dec 27th 2016 2:30PM Apple, unlike any other company in the world, is directly tied to one individual: Steve Jobs. Without question, Jobs was the driving force that turned Apple into the world's most valuable tech company. But Jobs didn't do it alone. He always had a team of talented people helping him build Apple. Sadly, many of them have been forgotten — which is why we've gathered information on the first 10 employees at the company. Apple's first CEO, Michael Scott, gave us a bunch of color on the early days, and Steve Wozniak helped with a list of early employees, though it was based on his memory. We got our full list from another early employee. The Apple employee numbers aren't the order each person joined the company. When Scott came to Apple, he had to give out numbers to each employee to make life easier for the payroll department. Jay Yarow contributed to an earlier version of this story. 10. Gary Martin was in charge of accounting Martin thought Apple was going to flop, but joined the company anyway. He stayed at Apple until 1983. From Apple he jumped to Starstruck, a company working on space travel. For the next few decades he moved from one CFO position to another at a few companies. 9. Sherry Livingston was the right hand for Apple's first CEO Livingston was the first secretary at Apple, and she did a lot. Michael Scott, who hired her, said she basically did all the odds and ends work for Apple in the early days.

It was the first mass-marketed personal computer. The Apple II was a single-board computer like the Apple I, but the Apple II was much improved, going several steps further than its predecessor. The Apple II had the BASIC (Beginner's All Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language built in, and it had the ability to display text and graphics in colour.

It was the first Apple machine to incorporate a built-in 5.25 inch floppy disk drive and high-resolution graphics built into the motherboard. Unfortunately the machines suffered from numerous problems and sold poorly. An improved and lower-priced Apple III was launched in 1981, followed by a III+ in 1983, but the computers continued to be unpopular, and production ceased in 1985.

It was also designed to use a graphical display rather than the standard text-based display previously used.

Incorporating the powerful Motorola 68000 processor, and a mouse and pull-down menus, Lisa was intended by Appleï¿½s founder, Steve Jobs, to set the technological standard and become the market leader in personal computers. Unfortunately, at just under $10,000 when launched in 1983, the price was too high for most potential buyers, but the innovations of the Lisa led directly to Appleï¿½s successful Macintosh.

Chris Espinosa was working at Apple part-time in high school — and he still works there! Chris Espinosa joined Apple when he was 14, and still in high school. He's still with the company today — he's actually Apple's longest-serving employee at this point. On his personal blog he said he ended up as employee No. 8 because when CEO Michael "Scotty" Scott was giving out numbers, he was at school. He arrived late and ended up with the "wrong" number. Sorry Chris! 7. Michael "Scotty" Scott was the original CEO Scott told us he gave himself No. 7, as a joke. It's a reference to James Bond — 007. Scotty, as he was known, picked all the numbers for employees and organized the company. He was brought in as CEO by Mike Markkula, the man who invested $250,000 in Apple and helped map out its business plan. 6. Randy Wigginton ended up working for several important tech companies Wigginton's main job was to rewrite BASIC so it would work for the Apple II, Michael Scott told us in an interview. BASIC is an early programming language — the stuff at the core of computing. In his post-Apple life he's worked at eBay, Google, Chegg, and Square, among others. Not a bad run! 5. Rod Holt was super important in the development of the Apple II Holt was a highly regarded designer who was skeptical of joining Apple initially. But, in "Return To The Little Kingdom," he says Steve Jobs "conned" him into taking the job. Holt helped develop the power supply for the Apple II. After six years at Apple, Holt says he was pushed out of the company by new management. 4. Bill Fernandez was the first employee after the two Steves Bill Fernandez first met Steve Jobs at Cupertino Junior High School when Jobs was a new student. Fernandez was also a neighbor and friend of Steve Wozniak. Here's how Fernandez describes it on his LinkedIn profile: "Introduced the founders, Woz and Jobs. Was later hired by them as Apple's first employee. Occupied many positions, first in hardware, later in software, and finally in user interface design. Worked on the Apple-1, Apple-2, Macintosh and other hardware projects. Worked on the MacOS, QuickTime, HyperCard and other software projects." When Jobs and Wozniak started Apple, they hired Fernandez as the first employee. He stayed with Apple until 1993, when he left to work at Ingres, a database company. He currently works as CEO at a company named Omnibiotics. 3. Mike Markkula was the moneyman Markkula was as instrumental in developing Apple as either of the two Steves. He made an investment in Apple worth $250,000. In exchange for his investment, he took 30% of the company. He also helped manage the company, develop a business plan, hired the first CEO, and insisted Steve Wozniak join Apple. (At the time he was thinking about joining HP.) Markkula was an early Intel employee and became a millionaire by the time he was 30 when the company went public. According to "Return to the Little Kingdom," his investment in Apple was less than 10% of his total worth at the time. He stayed at Apple until 1997, overseeing the ouster and return of Steve Jobs. When Jobs came back, Markkula left. He has since invested in a few startups and donated money to Santa Clara University, for the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. 2. Steve Jobs became employee "Number 2," just to irk him Why is Jobs employee No. 2 and not No. 1? Michael Scott says, "I didn't give it to Jobs because I thought that would be too much." Jobs, as is well known, was ousted from Apple, created a new startup called NeXT, then came back and returned Apple to glory (when Apple bought NeXT). In between, he led Pixar. Steve Jobs died in October 2011. 1. Steve Wozniak was the technical expert Wozniak almost didn't join Apple. He had a job offer at HP in Oregon and was considering taking it. He made the right choice, clearly. Years later, "Woz" (as he's known) is still a regular face in Silicon Valley — he gives interviews, speeches, and has even appeared on "Dancing with the Stars." BONUS: Ronald Wayne decided to sell his shares for $1,700 Ronald Wayne was an original partner in Apple with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, but decided the business wasn't for him. He left. To make things official, Markkula bought out his stake in the company for $1,700 in 1977. In 2012, Wayne wrote an essay on why he left Apple. It's quite good: "I didn't separate myself from Apple because of any lack of enthusiasm for the concept of computer products. Aside from any immediate apprehension in regard to financial risks, I left because I didn't feel that this new enterprise would be the working environment that I saw for myself, essentially for the rest of my days. I had every belief [it] would be successful but I didn't know when, what I'd have to give up or sacrifice to get there, or how long it would take to achieve that success. ... To counter much that has been written in the press about me as of late, I didn't lose out on billions of dollars. That's a long stretch between 1976 and 2012. Apple went through a lot of hard times and many thought Apple would simply go out of business at various times in its maturity. I perhaps lost tens of millions of dollars. And quite honestly, between just you and me, it was character building."

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple publishes its first-ever AI research paper Apple Apple publishes its first-ever AI research paper By Bindu Nair - Dec 27, 2016 Apple hit headlines in early December when it announced that it would begin publishing AI papers, a significant break from its standard position of extreme secrecy. The tech behemoth has now followed through on its promise and come out with a document titled ‘Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training.’ The AI paper’s lead author is Apple researcher Ashish Shrivastava, who wrote the paper alongside Oncel Tuzel, Wenda Wang, Tomas Pfister, Josh Susskind, and Russ Webb. The paper focuses on the area of computer vision, talking about a technique to better an algorithm’s skill at recognizing objects via synthetic images. Machine learning researchers can either choose to utilize computer-generated or real-world images when training artificial intelligence. The former is considered more efficient since it’s already labeled and annotated. On the other hand, the latter requires a human touch since people will have to tag each and every thing a computer sees in a photo. Also Read: Apple to launch 5-inch iPhone with vertical dual cameras The main conundrum in using artificial images is that the neural network might not be able to translate its knowledge to actual snaps since they’re often not realistic enough. Apple’s solution for this problem is called Simulated + Unsupervised learning. The technique basically boosts the realism of generated snaps. Apple’s method is in fact a modified offshoot of a new machine learning procedure called Generative Adversarial Networks. The system pits two competing neural networks against each other in order to output photorealistic images. The brand apparently hopes to push its S +U learning method beyond still images to moving video in the future. Apple’s switch to openness when it comes to AI is a big step forward for the firm and may just help its recruiting efforts. Its earlier secrecy was widely criticized by the research community and prevented people from wanting to work for the company since they wouldn’t be able to publish their work or interact with others.

It’s unclear if any other countries are currently affected in the online store change but the change today leaves German buyers with the choice of using a credit card, PayPal, or financing as payment options. The prepayment option previously offered to German Apple online store customers allowed buyers to complete a bank wire transfer instead of using a credit card or PayPal to purchase their products. Customers would send payment to Apple’s payment processing company, and once the money had been received and cleared, Apple would then move onto to building and shipping out the order. Customers shopping stateside on Apple’s site wouldn’t normally see these options, but it appears to be more common overseas. Apple’s Shopping Help page gives more information on Bank Transfers explaining that for the UK, customers must call a specific number to place the order. For Germany, customers were provided with Apple’s payment processor’s banking information to help complete the transaction. Although the German Bank Transfer help page is still available, it’s not known if Apple will eventually move away from this option altogether. Customers who used to utilize the bank transfer could potentially see a delay in orders as the transfer would take five business days for payment processing. With Apple expanding Apple Pay across the globe, Apple VP Jennifer Bailey has previously said that Apple was working ‘rapidly’ to bring Apple Pay to more countries in Europe and Asia. That being said, Germany is still one of the European countries that has yet to see Apple Pay come to its banks.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: MOBILE Flurry: 44% of devices activated during Christmas week were from Apple, 21% from Samsung, and 3% from Huawei Emil Protalinski@EPro December 27, 2016 11:20 AM Tags: Amazon, Apple, Flurry, Huawei, lg, motorola, Oppo, Samsung, top-stories, Xiaomi, Yahoo Image Credit: Apple Every year, Christmas week brings in the highest number of new device activations and app installs. 2016 also had Hanukkah to help, but the main result was the same: Apple dominated the results. Just under half of device activations (44 percent) were for an Apple device this Christmas, down from 49.1 percent last year. One in five were Samsung devices (21 percent, up from 19.8 percent), with the rest of companies settling for single digits under 5 percent. Flurry’s data is global, although it is naturally skewed towards those that use its platform. The Yahoo-owned mobile analytics and advertising firm supports nearly 250,000 developers, reaching more than 800,000 apps across more than 2 billion devices with 10 billion sessions every day. This is the basis used to determine which devices were purchased and which apps were the first to be downloaded and installed. Microsoft unsurprisingly fell out of the list, while Huawei showed up to the party for the first time. The Apple-Samsung duopoly was as stark as ever: Keep in mind that throughout the year, Samsung dominates in phones and Apple wins in tablets. Aside from Samsung, Asian manufacturers typically don’t see much of a jump around this time of year, as Christmas is not the biggest gift-giving day in their home markets — Singles’ Day is much bigger in China, for example. Flurry also noted that Google struggled to make a mark with its new Pixel and Pixel XL this holiday season. As for the form-factor breakdown, Christmas 2016 kept up a trend of the past few years: a big jump in the number of phablets activated. In the week leading up to Christmas, 37 percent of new device activations were phablets (compared to 27 percent in 2015, 13 percent in 2014, and just 4 percent in 2013): In 2013 and 2014, the rise of phablets came at the expense of tablets. In 2015 and 2016, smaller-sized phones took the biggest hit. Unsurprisingly, new device activations result in more apps being downloaded and installed. More specifically, Flurry tracked two times the number of app installs on Christmas Day compared to an average day in the first three weeks of December, slightly down but in line with last year.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive 3rd Generation Taco restaurant lands at Apple Valley airport Tuesday Dec 27, 2016 at 10:50 AM Dec 27, 2016 at 3:56 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — The idea of two High Desert brothers and entrepreneurs has taken flight as 3rd Generation Taco has launched an eatery at a local airport. After running their successful catering company for nearly four years, brothers Ausencio and Xavier Ariza have begun selling their popular tacos, burritos and culinary favorites at the Apple Valley Airport. “We’re still working with our menu, but we’re up and running and excited to be working out of an actual building,” said Ausencio Ariza, 32, who still operates his 3rd Generation Taco mobile kitchen for public and private events. “Now that we have a kitchen, we’re working on expanding our menu.” Ausencio Ariza, who opened the airport location with his brother last month, said 3rd Generation is popular for its specialty burritos, burgers, wraps and salads. “We serve American and Mexican food, but we keep our roots with our tacos. We keep it simple, classic and affordable,” he said. With an extensive background in restaurant management, the brothers began their business by cooking at people’s homes with a simple backyard grill. As the catering business grew, they purchased a 6-foot taco grill from a mobile vendor in Los Angeles. “We got popular real fast — that’s when we purchased our mobile kitchen,” Ariza said. “We launched our taco trailer in the summer of 2015 and we’ve been swamped with business ever since. “We decided to open the restaurant because we wanted to establish a base of operation,” said Ariza, as he prepared to cater an upcoming event. “The restaurant space was ideal and the kitchen was perfect for what we need to do. It has a small taco-feel and that’s what we were looking for.” Ariza said the eatery’s breakfast menu is beginning to attract large crowds, with many ordering the short stack, French toast, the classic two-egg breakfast and even burgers. “We serve breakfast and lunch during store hours,” said Ariza, who used to work for In-N-Out Burger, Chipotle and the Apple Valley Golf Course. “Whether it’s French toast or tacos, we cover all the bases.” Ariza told the Daily Press the 3rd Generation Taco name is a reference to the family’s third generation Hispanic/American culture. “My brother and I thought of it sitting around the coffee table discussing different names for the business,” Ariza said. “We thought 3rd Generation sounded good. Our mom's side migrated from Mexico and our father’s side from Spain.” Ariza said his father used to own Ariza Cheese factory in Paramount and his mother worked at Bechtel. The airport restaurant is the former home to Skidmark’s Cafe, the Leonard Airport Cafe, Wild Willie’s Smokehouse and the Hang Out Cafe. “We grew up here so we have pretty deep roots,” Ariza said. “We love our community and our goal is to provide our customers with quality food that’s tasty and affordable.” 3rd Generation Taco is open 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. The restaurant is at 21600 Corwin Road in Apple Valley. The restaurant will be closed New Year’s Day.

Unfortunately, it didn’t extend the courtesy to the UK store. Fret not though. If you're on the lookout for a hefty discount, Argos has you covered in the post-Christmas sales. The catalogue store is offering an Apple Watch Series 1 Sport for £199 right now, which is a £60 discount on the RRP. DEAL: Buy an Apple Watch for under £200 at Argos now There’s a range of colours available, but you are restricted to the 38mm model. If you’re requiring the 42mm face, you’ll need to splash out upwards of £249 for a Series 1 or Sport model, which is still an excellent saving of £50. This is the cheapest we’ve seen a new Apple Watch at a major UK retailer While it’s a probably a mental thing as much as anything, the price dropping below £200 could be just the incentive some folks have to jump on board with Apple’s first wearable. Of course, we must clarify that these aren’t the newest iteration of the watch. The Apple Watch Series 2, announced this autumn, now offers built in GPS and water resistance enabling wearers to swim with it.

The company now is continuing the trend and is introducing a ‘Ring In the New Year’ challenge as its next Apple Watch Activity Challenge. On the upside, unlike the Thanksgiving Day challenge, this New Years challenge is not restricted to the United States. Similarly, users will be able to unlock a special iMessage sticker and Activity achievement. All the user must do is fill all three rings in a week (Sunday through Saturday). Earn this special achievement when you close all three Activity rings each day for any full week, Monday to Sunday, in January. You’ll also earn special stickers in the Messages app. Also interesting is the mention of “stickers” vs “sticker” which suggests that completing the challenge will unlock multiple stickers, whereas the Thanksgiving challenge only unlocked one sticker. Completing the challenge will require filling up your daily move goal, finishing 30 minutes of exercise, and standing for at least one minute for 12 hours.

Apple TV vs Fire TV vs Chromecast and more Rik Henderson27 December 2016TV Netflix / Disney Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Video streaming has been one of the fastest growing areas of entertainment technology over the last few years, but it has never been as accessible or enjoyable as it is today. Not only do we have swathes of different streaming services, each offering thousands upon thousands of hours worth of movies and TV shows to watch on demand, but there are plenty of standalone set-top-boxes to play them through. Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video, BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and many others are all available on subscription or as a free service, but unless you have a Smart TV you'll need a separate device to use them. Thankfully, as long as you have a broadband internet connection capable of over 2Mbps speeds, there are plenty of options out there in the media streaming box market to add smart capabilities to an existing TV. And they needn't cost the Earth. Which is the best movie streaming service in the UK? Netflix vs Amazon Prime vs Now TV and more Netflix review: The leading light in home entertainment For less than £150 - sometimes considerably so - you can buy a small device that gives you all of the content you could ever want and then some. What's more, some of them even support Ultra HD streaming to match your latest 4K TV. So these are the contenders you should consider. Apple TV (4th generation) Price: From £139 Pocket-lint What is it? After sticking with the last generation for three years, Apple finally developed a new Apple TV box that is more powerful, has a touchscreen remote control with Siri voice recognition, and access to its own App Store to purchase and download tvOS apps based on their iOS equivalents. It provides access to Apple movies, TV shows and music bought or rented through iTunes, plus the Apple Music streaming service. And it can search for content across multiple services through the one search bar, bringing up results no matter the source. Apple TV review: Packed with potential Main apps There is an impressive line-up of applications and games to download and enjoy - many of them free. There are plenty of big name services available, including Flickr, YouTube and Airbnb. More importantly though, in video streaming terms, Netflix and Now TV apps are available - just like on the last Apple TV. TVPlayer and iBox TV UK are present to watch British TV channels through the device. And there are several home media streaming apps, including Plex and Infuse. There's no Amazon Prime Instant Video yet, strangely. And while there is a BBC iPlayer app on the platform, we're still awaiting ITV Hub, My5 and All 4. In the meantime, you can always stream content through the iPad or iPhone equivalent apps to the box thanks to Airplay. Like Amazon Fire TV and the Nvidia Shield Android TV, another major aspect to the Apple TV is that it doubles as a great casual games console too. There are plenty of titles already available, some of which almost identical to their dedicated console counterparts, such as Skylanders Superchargers and Guitar Hero Live. Best Apple TV games: What to play first For Having more power under the hood gives the new Apple TV more oomph to move quicker and offer more features. You can use voice search contextually, for example, by asking the box to filter movies by a genre and then a certain star by saying things like, "Siri find action movies" and then "only those that star Roger Moore as James Bond". The remote control is also a motion controller, which might make family gaming a little more fun without the need for a full console. Plus, the touchscreen is a great new addition. It also still performs many of the other functions its predecessor is capable of, including Apple Airplay to stream iPhone and iPad content to the box. Although this time it has better Wi-Fi built in (up to 802.11ac) so should have better range and attain better data speeds on a home network. Against There are few main issues with the new Apple TV, although we are disappointed that it does not support 4K video. That might be included somewhere down the line (not at 60fps or with HDR thanks to the more restrictive HDMI 1.4 output) but it can only output 1080p at present. Sound is better served though, with Dolby Digital 7.1 support. Conclusion Even without 4K, the new Apple TV is an attractive prospect. The inclusion of an actual App Store is a much-needed improvement, although only time will tell whether it will become as jam packed with useful applications as Apple's other devices. It's worth talking about the price though, with the 32GB model weighing in at just shy of £140. You get the remote in the box, but if you want to use it as a games console substitute you'll also need to buy a third-party Bluetooth controller. And you don't even get a HDMI cable with it - although you can pick one up for around a quid these days. We suspect those who are already happy within the Apple ecosystem will get the most from it, considering it taps into iCloud, Apple Music and other existing iTunes content. We especially like that you don't have to repurchase games if you have already bought them for iPhone or iPad. Amazon Fire TV Price: £79.99 Pocket-lint What is it? After enormous success with its 2014 model, Amazon updated its Fire TV set-top-box in 2015 with some key new features - not least 4K video streaming. It's built on an Android base, much like Amazon's tablets and Fire OS, and has had a brand new operating system update recently to make it more simple to find and view content, regardless of the source. The box is powered by a quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM, plus has some interesting features including a microphone in the remote control to allow for voice operated search. A separate, compatible games controller is available too (for £34.99) which illustrates that gaming is equally high on Amazon's agenda as movies, TV shows and other content. It's worth pointing out though that the latest versions of the remote and game controller now connect through Wi-Fi rather than Bluetooth, so have lower latency. Amazon Fire TV 4K Ultra HD: Embracing a new age for entertainment Main apps Like with Apple TV and Apple content, the Amazon Fire TV immediately offers Amazon-based content as soon as you fire it up. It offers music, movies, TV shows - some to buy and some to rent - and the box is intrinsically linked with Amazon Prime Instant, the company's subscription service. However, other, rival services are also available, including Netflix, Sky News and YouTube, with content being integrated in the new design almost as much as Amazon's own. BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4 and My5 (previously known as Demand 5) are also available as catch-up services in the UK. One big draw is that, when compared with its closest competitors in box terms, the box supports 4K Ultra HD video. You can purchase or rent a healthy collection of higher resolution films to play through the box to a compatible television, or stream 4K versions of Amazon's own originals TV series at no extra cost if you are a Prime subscriber. There are also plenty of games available on the platform too. For Amazon has rapidly become of the biggest in the TV set-top-box business because it offers so much for an affordable price. The latest user interface even integrates its rivals' content into the experience so you can search for a show across platforms. And its gaming prowess is still an interesting prospect, even though it's not the box's primary purpose. This version of the box also has 802.11ac Wi-Fi for greater range, more stability and higher bandwidth than before. And a microSD card slot is present to expand the storage for app downloads by up to a further 128GB (from the initial 8GB). But the 4K video output is its headline positive feature, of course. Against Like with its Fire tablets, the operating system of Fire TV is closed and task specific. That might put off some, but it's hardly original amongst the company here. You also might not fancy investing all your money in Amazon products, so that would dampen its use somewhat for you.  Conclusion Amazon entered the market with a bang and the latest iteration is quite simply superb. The box is, on paper and in the flesh, a powerful proposition. It's great if you are a keen Amazon purchaser or Amazon Prime Instant subscriber, and even better if you love dabbling with casual games too. The retailer has also kept it cheap enough to compete directly with Roku, yet also offers 4K video. Compelling. Amazon Fire TV Stick Price: £34.99 Pocket-lint What is it? Amazon's Fire TV Stick isn't as powerful as the main set-top-box, featuring a dual-core processor and 1GB of RAM instead, but it does the same job and will also get a user interface update in early 2017. Amazon Fire TV Stick review: Stick it to 'em Main apps Like the Fire TV box, the stick version is mainly centred on the Amazon Prime experience, with Prime Instant Video, Amazon Music and a link-up to images stored on the Amazon Cloud being at the forefront. All other apps are available on the stick too, save for some of the more graphically intensive games, which require the beefier processor. That means Netflix, BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5, Plex - for those with home stored content they want to stream - and many more are available on the store. For Bar 4K video, just about everything the Fire TV STB can do the Fire TV Stick can too. It's just not as quick in operation. It does have dual-band Wi-Fi though. Its remote doesn't require line-of-sight, which is obviously really as the stick will invariably be hidden from sight. It is capable of 1080p output with 7.1 audio through the HDMI. And you can even take it on holiday with you as Amazon has added a cunning way for you to input room and log-in details for connection to hotel Wi-Fi. Against To keep the cost down, the remote that comes with the Fire TV Stick is more bare bones than the one with the larger unit. It doesn't therefore have voice search capability as there is no microphone. Those who do want to utilise that feature can use a dedicated Fire TV remote app on their iPhone, Fire Phone or Android device. Alternatively, you can buy an optional remote with the mic for an additional £25. Or even choose a slightly pricier version of the Fire TV Stick that comes with the more fully-featured remote in the box. It is still best served when coupled with an Amazon Prime subscription. Conclusion Amazon came to the dongle market at an opportune point. It had hindsight on its side so introduced a direct rival to Chromecast and the Roku Streaming Stick that offered better tech inside to ensure a smoother experience. Both of its rivals have improved recently, but the Fire TV Stick is still incredibly useful for its price. Its price is also very attractive. Roku 3 Price: £79.99 Pocket-lint What is it? The Roku 3 is Roku's top-end streaming box, but if you can make do with fewer features there is also the Roku 2 box for around £60. Like the Apple TV and Fire TV, it offers 1080p output through HDMI, but has access to a much larger library of applications, some very useful, many very niche. The Roku 3 comes with a wireless remote control that is not IR dependant so can be used anywhere and at any angle. It also has motion sensors like a Wii console remote and can double as a basic gamepad. Roku 3 review (2015): Voice-controlled set-top box smarts Main apps There are almost 2,000 apps (called channels) available through Roku's Channel Store, many free but some will cost - especially games. BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, All 4 and My5 (Demand 5) are present, completing the catch-up foursome. There are also apps for Netflix and Amazon Video. Because BSkyB is one of Roku's investors, Now TV has a fully-functioning application on the box that gives you access to the entertainment, movie and sports packages. The Sky Store app adds access to day-and-date releases for purchase or rental. Or, if you are a regular Android user, you can access your Google Play account on Roku boxes to stream bought or rented movies and TV shows. Even if you are not, you can still sign up for an account. Roku also gives access to YouTube, Vimeo and Flixster for the more casual video watcher. The latter gives access to your UltraViolet digital film library if you've been collecting vouchers from Blu-rays. For Roku has an excellent name around the tech industry and home streaming fans alike. Its boxes are simple to understand and install and the wealth of content available from the off is quite staggering. The Roku 3 also has apps that can stream media from your home network servers, including Plex. A paid-for Dropbox app will even let you access your cloud files and pictures in a similar way to Apple's iCloud access. The Roku 3's remote control is excellent. You don't have to point it at the box to use it, meaning you can tuck the Roku device away out of sight (not that it's that large anyway), and because it doubles as a motion controller and gamepad, you can use it to play titles such as Angry Birds on the big screen. It also features a headphone port on the side, which allows you to listen to shows and movies through a headset remotely and wirelessly. The box is capable of outputting up to 1080p visuals and has dual-band Wi-Fi as well as an Ethernet port for direct connection - handy if you plan to use it in a bedroom, far from your wired internet connection. Like Google's Chromecast, you can cast Netflix and YouTube content from within their respective smartphone apps straight to the TV. Against There are a few app omissions, and many of the downloadable channels are junk, to be honest. The user interface is either basic and sparse or simple to use, depending on your point of view, and there are quite a lot of gaps in its file compatibility for native media sharing. However, the Plex app will stream other file types (if you have a system set-up to take advantage of it or a Plex server running on a computer), and some rivals don't even offer the option in the first place. Sadly, although the US has had 4K support for a while, the flagship device in the UK is not capable of Ultra HD playback. Conclusion Roku is an excellent platform if you don't want to lock your content or subscriptions to just one or two places. It could really do with supporting 4K in the UK though. Check out roku.com for information on the Roku 3 and its lesser spec'ed family member, Roku 2. They each offer just as much in the way of movie and TV show streaming. The Roku Streaming Stick too. Roku Streaming Stick Price: £29.99 Pocket-lint What is it? Like the Roku 3 and the other members of the family, the Roku Streaming Stick gives access to the vast library of applications on the Roku store, most of which are free to download. However, it more resembles the first generation Google Chromecast or Fire TV Stick in shape and size. Rather than a set-top-box, it is a dongle-like device that fits into a HDMI port and therefore out of sight. It also comes with a remote control (that's actually bigger than the device itself), although it's not the wireless motion controller the Roku 3 uses. It still uses wireless technology other than IR though - after all, with it tucked behind a telly, you don't get line of sight. Roku Streaming Stick review Main apps Like the Roku 3, the Streaming Stick has access to hundreds of apps (channels), including the solid line-up of main movie and streaming services. Amazon Video has recently been added, and you also get Netflix, BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, All 4, My5 (Demand 5) and the others mentioned for the device's stablemate above. Without the games control aspect of the remote though, it is not compatible with the games titles, such as Angry Birds. For Its stealth design means that a flatscreen can be turned into a smart TV without the need for extra wires or fuss. It is capable of outputting up to 1080p video and has dual-band Wi-Fi connectivity like its larger cousin (although there is no wired internet connection, so you'll need to be in range of a decent wireless signal). Like all Roku products, it is simple to set up and get working within minutes. And if you download a dedicated application for your smartphone, you can stream your video, music and picture files to the stick, in similar fashion to Airplay. Against The lack of an Ethernet connection might be a problem for some, especially those who don't have a great Wi-Fi signal throughout the house. It is sadly not completely wire-free as it needs to be powered through USB. You will either need to plug it into the wall via an included power adapter or, if your TV has a powered USB port, you can hook it up to that to keep cables discrete. Like the Roku 3, some of the missing apps leave holes in what you can watch - although there is so much else you might not care. Conclusion This isn't the first time that Roku has offered a Streaming Stick solution. However, the first one used a specific type of port that is not available on a vast number of sets globally. The HDMI version is ideal therefore. It has also been updated more recently, with a quad-core processor that makes it much smoother to use. It certainly offers an ideal way to turn a TV into a smart one without much fuss. Ideal for a bedroom perhaps. Now TV Price: £14.99 Pocket-lint What is it? Refreshed from the first generation, the latest Now TV box is made by Roku and is therefore similar in size and style to that manufacturer's own-branded devices. Its purpose is to present Sky's Now TV content in as easy a way as possible for those who don't already own a home entertainment device capable of accessing the service. It accesses all of the Now TV movies, TV channels, kids channels and sport, but since its original launch, it has effectively become a basic version of the Roku box service, although the user interface is completely different. A number of key apps and services are included on the box as well as Sky's own channels and catch-up. New Now TV Box (2015) arrives, we get watching the latest movies, TV and sport Main apps Naturally, the Now TV box's raison d'être is to provide access to Now TV - Sky's streaming service that offers four separate subscription or pay models for movies, entertainment, kids and sports. But since launch it has also added apps for BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, All 4, My5 (Demand 5), Vimeo, YouTube, Flixster and other streaming services. There is also access to the Sky Store to rent or buy modern day-and-date films as they are released on Blu-ray and DVD. All of these you can access and use, even if you don't subscribe to any of the Now TV packages. For The main selling point of the Now TV box is clearly its price. At £14.99 it undercuts all rivals dramatically. You can buy it from £24.99 as well, which includes money saving bundles for sports, entertainment or movies access, but for just fifteen quid you actually get so much included. It connects to your network through Wi-Fi or Ethernet (a recent addition), and is very simple to set up. The user interface design is fresh and new, but it could be considered a very entry-level Roku box in many ways. The box also includes USB and microSD card slots, to play back local media files. Against There are a few caveats to the price of the Now TV box. For a start, the Now TV service only offers 720p video at present and stereo audio, even though the box is capable of 1080p. That might change in future, according to Sky staff posting on its dedicated forums, but this puts it at a disadvantage when compared to many rival devices. Also, because this is a box designed to encourage you to take out a subscription to the Now TV streaming packages, it is unlikely to ever offer direct paid-for rivals, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Wuaki.tv or others. Services that Sky doesn't offer, such as music streaming, are catered for however. At present that includes a Spotify app and TuneIn Radio for internet radio stations. Conclusion Some might say that with the Now TV box you get what you pay for. It's own content is only 720p and stereo and the box has a limited library of apps available for it compared to others, but we would argue that you get far more for your money that you can rightly expect. Also, with the potential to output 1080p video and 7.1 surround sound, there is a possibility that the content will end up matching the technical specifications. And it cannot be denied that this is a cheap way to ensure you are up to speed with the streaming revolution. As a bedroom machine, it is quite simply perfect. Now TV Smart Box Price: £39.99 Pocket-lint What is it? The Now TV Smart Box is a recent addition to Sky's streaming device family and represents a step up from its cheaper, older sibling. That's because, as well as offer the same access to Now TV services and other streaming apps, the Smart Box also contains a digital TV tuner so you can use it as your main TV provider too. All of the 60 standard and 12 high definition Freeview channels are available, with complete integration into the user experience. It is slightly smoother in operation too, thanks to a quad-core processor over the standard Now TV box's dual-core equivalent. Now TV Smart Box review: Is live TV and Sky in one device worth the price? Main apps Like the Now TV box, the main reason for the Now TV Smart Box is to provide access to the different, contract-free passes offered by Sky. However, it also has the terrestrial catch-up apps and other services. The interesting part is the ability to pause and rewind live TV, as broadcast through the digital TV tuner. You cannot record onto the device, however. For If you have an old TV without a Freeview tuner this is a no brainer as it will also offer smart, connected functionality for a reasonable price. You might also favour all your viewing from the same source, so the box works nicely as you don't have to switch from service to service on your TV. If you're after a no-contract combination deal of broadband, TV and phone line, you can also get the Now TV Smart Box for free as part of the deal. Against Sadly, like its stablemate, while it is capable of 1080p output, Now TV streams are 720p and stereo. You do get Full HD with broadcast HD TV channels though. Again, there is a lack of rival services to Sky's, such as Netflix and Amazon Video. Conclusion The Now TV Smart Box is definitely a step-up option, but we're not sure of its market. Just about anyone interested in media streaming will likely have a TV with Freeview already, so don't really need the TV tuner. And if that's the case, the £14.99 Now TV box is ample. Still, if you do opt for a contractless combo, it's a nice add-on to have. Google Chromecast Price: £30 Pocket-lint What is it? Like the Roku Streaming Stick and Fire TV Stick, Google's Chromecast device is a dongle that plugs directly into a HDMI port on your TV. It's not quite a movie and TV show streaming solution like many of the others listed here. Instead, it works with compatible apps you have on your smartphone or tablet and plays their video or music content on a larger screen. Unlike Apple TV though, that's not done by mirroring a device, using the processing power of the phone or tablet, instead the Chromecast pulls the content from the internet itself. It effectively turns your mobile device into a remote control. Chromecast 2 review: Make any TV smart, effortlessly Main apps It is capable of playing Netflix content, YouTube and any Google Play movies, TV shows or music you might have bought. Android, iPhone and iPad apps that have also added support include BBC iPlayer, My5, BT Sport, Now TV, Blinkbox, Wuaki.tv, Deezer and there are plenty of others too. Spotify is part of the mix too. Plex support also means you can stream your own content through a computer too. Gaming is available on the latest model, with certain games having the ability to Cast the action to the device and then onto the big screen. The list of titles will expand as the feature develops, but Angry Birds Go is one of the biggest name games already featuring support. For Google Chromecast is cheap and ridiculously simple to use. You just tell the specific app to send video to the device by tapping the dedicated icon and the rest is done for you. As the stream is taken by the Chromecast over the internet, not from your phone or tablet, you can carry on using your mobile device as normal. Chromecast may be a Google product, but it also works with iPhone, iPod touch and iPad as well as Android devices and computers running Chrome. You can even cast a tab through the Google browser to your big screen, so can watch online video from websites too. That makes up for the shortfall of supported apps..  Against Even though app support is growing rapidly, there are still some glaring holes, especially with British broadcasters and content delivery services. The second-gen Chromecast has solved the problem for owners who wall-mount their sets, as it no longer sticks out the back and has a flexible USB cable built-in, but it does still require separate power. And not having its own user interface, you'll always need a phone, tablet or computer to hand to operate it. Conclusion Google's Chromecast is cheap - remarkably so - and interesting. It is the most simple solution for getting Google Play content onto a big screen TV and is a great alternative to Apple Airplay. It does have an interesting rival in the Amazon Fire TV Stick but the latest version has enough oomph to work well for the price. Google Chromecast Ultra Price: £69 Pocket-lint What is it? A newer, more expensive addition to the Chromecast family is Google's first device with 4K Ultra HD streaming capabilities. It also supports Dolby Vision and HDR for those with compatible TVs. And an Ethernet connection means you can hard wire it to ensure your video streaming remains smooth and stable. It is also a dongle like the conventional Chromecast, with a similar form factor. And again, you use a smartphone or computer to control it, with the Ultra streaming video over the internet based on what you "Cast" to the device. Google Chromecast Ultra review: 4K casting is perfect... yet pointless Main apps The exact same app line-up for the standard Chromecast is supported here. The main difference however, is that the Chromecast Ultra is capable of streaming 4K video from relevant services, such as Netflix and YouTube. Netflix, for example, is capable of streaming 4K Dolby Vision (or HDR) video to compatible televisions. You can also stream from terrestrial apps, like BBC iPlayer, All 4 and Now TV, although they do not currently support 4K. For If you have a 4K TV and want the best video quality it is worth paying a bit extra for the more capable Chromecast. Its Dolby Vision support - which can only really be found on LG OLED TVs at present - is welcome and not found on many rival devices. The faster internet connectivity, needed for 4K video streaming, also ensures than non Ultra HD video is presented at its best too. Against If you don't have a 4K TV you do not need a Chromecast Ultra. You might also find that your swanky UHD set actually has all the apps and features you need anyway. Conclusion The Chromecast Ultra is an interesting proposition but is possibly more one for the future than right now, thanks to a lack of 4K services. As Amazon Video doesn't yet support casting, it's missing a major player in the field. It's also highly priced for a dongle, especially when you consider the more capable Fire TV box is only slightly more expensive.  Nvidia Shield Android TV Price: From £169.99 (including game controller) Pocket-lint What is it? Available with the Shield controller included in the bundle, the Shield TV box is only a tad over our £150 budget but is the most powerful option in our round-up. It has much more firepower under the hood so is potentially faster and more powerful than anything else on the market. It is also capable of outputting 4K video in 60 frames per second and HDR. In addition, it utilises an Nvidia chipset that is very capable with gaming, so has a stack of optimisation abilities for games that none of the other rival boxes can match. Nvidia Shield Android TV review: 4K and gaming meet in powerhouse box Main apps As an Android TV box, the Nvidia Shield TV has access to Google Play content, including its app store, a dedicated app for video and one for music. Google's YouTube service is also represented too, which is important as it's one of the sources for 4K content. It also comes with Plex and Netflix pre-installed, with the latter capable of Ultra HD streaming in HDR. There are also Nvidia dedicated apps for its different game services, such as the enhanced versions of Android games that require the box's beefier graphical specs to run, the ability to stream games from a local PC, and the firm's own cloud gaming service, GeForce Now. Thanks to the Google Play Store, hundreds of other apps are available too, including the much-loved free media streaming app Kobi. Disney's streaming service Disney Life is also available, as is Twitch. For As well as bundle a Shield game controller in the box, which shows exactly where Nvidia's heart lies, the biggest advantage the Shield Android TV has over nigh-on every other competitor here lies in its chipset. It runs on an Nvidia Tegra X1 processor with a 256-core GPU and 3GB of RAM. Not only does that ensure that gaming is almost console level, but it can output 4K Ultra HD video at 60fps as capably as most can handle 720p or 1080p. It also has a HDMI 2.0 output too - another thing few others sport. There are two USB 3.0 ports on the device, so external hardware can be added to expand the storage (16GB is available in the starter model), the same can be said through the microSD card slot. However, the USB ports are also capable of accepting any other USB device, such as a keyboard and mouse, or even a wired Xbox 360 controller. It can even double as a Google Chromecast, so you can use an Android or iOS device to send other content to it. Against In design terms, the Shield TV is very gamer-ish. It looks best standing up when attached to an optional Shield Stand, and its glowing green LED lighting makes it look like a miniature gaming PC. It can't therefore hide quite so comfortably as one of its peers. That said though, it's still svelte, so if you have an AV cabinet it's easy enough to tuck away. The Shield Remote control is also an optional extra, so will cost you an additional £40. Conclusion There's little doubt that of all the streaming boxes available on the market right now, the Shield TV is the most powerful and most capable. It is the only box currently on the market to offer 4K video at 60 frames per second, which is only available through YouTube at present but there are plenty of codecs on board to cope with other services when they launch. It is also ideally placed to rule the roost when it comes to casual gaming - something both Apple and Amazon are keen to exploit too. The included controller works on Wi-Fi Direct so has little to no latency and the graphics processor is geared up exactly for games. If you are looking for something a little more powerful it's definitely worth considering stretching your budget a bit further.

Apple had altogether a good year if we look from the lens of the iPhone 7 demand and AirPods. Yet, toward the end of 2016, the company started suffering from a slew of software issues with many of its devices. In the coming year, the company is expected to cover more ground with its devices, especially since rivals such as Samsung Galaxy Note series will be out of the running, at least for the first half of the year. Here’s what you can expect from Apple in 2017: iPhone 8: iPhone 8 is expected to be a major iPhone generation for Apple; especially since iPhone 8 (also being called the 7S or iPhone X) is its tenth-anniversary iPhone. The device is expected to have all-glass edge-to-edge display, which means that Apple will be making an iPhone without the physical home button for the first time. The company is expected to go for a virtual home button instead. An OLED iPhone 8 variant is also expected to be in the works. OLED displays are more power efficient and show better images than traditional LCD displays. Other expected features of the device include an A11 processor made with 10nm technology, which is expected to be more performance-optimized and battery efficient than the current device. Additionally, it is also expected to sport wireless charging and iris scanning. In terms of camera technology, it is expected to come with a multi-sensor camera with light sensing capabilities that will produce more color optimized images. iPad Series: Apple is expected to come out with an eighth generation iPad and an iPad Pro with a screen size between its existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. New iMac and MacBooks: The company is expected to tweak the MacBooks and iMacs in 2017. The expected changes could be USB Type-C connectors and improved graphics chip. The company needs to step up its game for the iMac, ever since its newfound competition from the Surface Studio all-in-one PC. Augmented Reality (AR) devices — Apple CEO Tim Cook signaled his interest in AR in September and stated that instead of jumping on the VR bandwagon like other major tech companies, Apple would be more interested in AR. Efforts to this end are being made, the newest development being the arrival of the AR game Pokémon Go on Apple Watch.

Read all about it below: Related articles Today's channel rundown - 27 December 2016 Today's channel rundown - 24 March 2016 Today's channel rundown - 27 September 2016 Today's channel rundown - 23 September 2016 Apple's batteries, iPhone, AI Apple has responded to an announcement made last week by Consumer Reports that it could not recommend the vendor's new MacBook models owing to battery inconsistencies, 9to5Mac reports. It was the the first time Consumer Reports has ever denied the vendor its nod of approval. While Consumer Reports noted that the MacBook "did very well" in measures of display quality and performance, the noporift organizarion said that in terms of battery life, it found that the models varied dramatically from one trial to another. "As a result, these laptops are the first MacBooks not to receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports," the organization said. Apple marketing executive Phil Schiller has responded by saying the vendor will work with Consumer Reports to better understand the tests, claiming that the rating doesn't match the vendor's lab tests or field data, 9to5Mac said. Meanwhile, rumors are starting to fly on Apple's next iPhone not slated for release until September, 2017. Word has apparently leaked from the vendor's supply chain in Asia that the company is working on three new models and could introduce a new five-inch unit along with the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch it currently offers, according to the Taiwan based Mac Otakara, as Fortune reports. The three models would sport the same technology, the report said. Apple reportedly won't make a final decision on its design plans for another three months. Separately, Apple published its first artificial intelligence paper on 22 December, in which it describes a method to improve the training of an algorithm's ability to recognize images from computer-generated rather than physical world images, Forbes reports. The paper, entitled Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training, is authored by Apple employees Ashish Shrivastava, Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Josh Susskind, Wenda Wang and Russ Webb. Telecom's innovation The majority of U.S. telecom CEOs consider innovation as a competitive advantage but may not be integrating it into their company's cultures, according to the 2016 KPMG CEO Outlook survey. In the poll of 56 U.S. telecom CEOs, 70 percent say innovation is among the top three issues on their personal agenda. But only half said that their organizations had a defined approach to innovation that touched the entire company. About one-third described their organization's approach to innovation as "accelerated", while only 18 percent called their approach to innovation "strategic". The remaining respondents described their approach to innovation as either ad hoc or siloed, the survey said. Sxity-four percent of the CEOs in the study were most concerned about cyber security. Only two percent said they were fully prepared against a cyber security attack. Of note, only 23 percent indicated they are extremely concerned with their organization's ability to stay on top of the next wave of new products and services. About 41 percent said they were extremely concerned about new market entrants disrupting their business models, according to the research. Red Hat's Q3 climb Open source software provider Red Hat has reported a 27 percent spike in EPS to $0.61 for its Q3 on a 17.5 percent climb in revenue to $615 million, as compared to the same period last year. Analysts had forecast $0.58 EPS for the period. GAAP net income for the quarter was $68 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with $47 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $111 million as compared to $89 million in the year-ago quarter. Total subscription revenue for the period rose 19 percent from last year to $543 million, and application development-related and other emerging technology sales rose 33 percent to $112 million. Red Hat is projecting Q4 sales of $614 million to $622 million and fully diluted GAAP EPS of approximately $0.33 per share. For the full year, the company expects sales of $2.4 billion and GAAP earnings of about $1.33 a share. Meanwhile, CFO Frank Calderoni will step down effective in late January 2017 to take up a CEO post at an as-yet-unidentified firm, Red Hat announced last week. The company said it will appoint Eric Shander, its current VP of finance and accounting, as interim CFO while it searches for a permanent successor to Calderoni. Ericsson/Cisco's partnership Cisco and telecoms equipment manufacturer Ericsson plan to expand their existing partnership beyond operators to new corporate clients and the public sector in 2017, Reuters reports. Ericsson's North America boss, Rima Qureshi, told Reuters that the two companies are on track to achieve an extra $1 billion each in revenues by 2018 through the partnership initially struck late in 2015. The arrangement has produced about 60 deals so far, mostly with telecom operators, he said. Qureshi said the partners are looking to the Internet of Things, smart cities, transportation, utilities and security for potential customers, according to the report. Ericsson expects to generate up to 25 percent of revenue from business outside of telecom operators by 2020, the exec said. Fairpoint's layoffs Regional broadband provider FairPoint Communications is laying off more than 100 workers across Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, according to an Associated Press report in the Burlington Free Press. FairPoint officials pointed to declining revenues and competition in the telecom market for the layoffs. Earlier this month, Consolidated Communications bought Fairpoint for $1.5 billion in a deal to extend its fiber network to an additional 17 states. Panasonic's Tesla deal Panasonic and car maker Tesla have announced they will begin production of photovoltaic cells and modules at a factory in Buffalo, New York, Reuters reports. The deal is expected to bring 1,400 jobs to the area, with 500 positions designated for manufacturing and the remainder for an intended expansion. The two companies said they have finalized an agreement in which Panasonic will underwrite the manufacturing costs with Tesla committing to a long-term buying arrangement. Production is slated to begin by mid-year 2017, the companies said.

According to Equities.com analyst, Michael Markowski, Redmond giant could be the first company to have a valuation over $1 trillion. Currently, the highest any company, technology or otherwise, has gone was $710 billion recorded by Apple back in February 2015. It slid down not long after to its current state of $617 billion. Markowski debates that Microsoft’s software model makes it more expandable than companies like Apple who focus more on hardware, with higher margins and cash flow. Out of tech companies, Apple still rules the roost with a market capitalization of $617 billion, followed by Alphabet at $548 billion, Microsoft $492 billion, Amazon $359 billion and Facebook at $333 billion. Another important piece of the puzzle is LinkedIn, which Microsoft acquired recently for $26.2 billion. The move could bring great rewards to Microsoft in the flourishing business social media market. Microsoft benefits from paying much less per user on the network than companies like Facebook, at just $60 per user rather than $218 for Facebook. The expected rise of LinkedIn from its 433 million users at present to 700 million users by 2020 could be a deciding factor. The only company that can challenge Microsoft according to him is Alphabet, which could make it a two-horse race in the technology arena. Apple is likely going to be watching from the grandstands.       Source Tags: Apple | Google | Microsoft Web Desk Website Previous ArticleShiv Sena takes dig at Modi for Nawaz birthday greetings Next Article Russia, Turkey ‘agree Syria ceasefire plan’ Related Stories Erdogan says Istanbul nightclub attack sought to create chaos in Turkey The best shots by Pakistani photographers in 2016 will give you hope for the new year UN Security Council unanimously backs Syria peace plan Leave A Reply Cancel Reply Your Name (required) Your Email (required) Your Website (optional) Connect with Us 2845followers 42225likes 43followers You Might Also Like Apple reveals autonomous vehicle ambitions SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) - Apple has revealed it is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles in ...read more Apple Is Keeping iPhone Call Logs Through iCloud: Security Firm Apple seems to be an advocate of their users’ privacy, on the outside at least.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Use the Pokémon Go App for Apple Watch The makers of Pokémon Go have released their long-awaited Apple Watch app, which is sure to please Watch wearing Pokémon trainers everywhere. Despite waning popularity, Niantic continues to update and refine Pokémon Go with fixes and new features such as the buddy system and the catch bonus system. Perhaps the most newsworthy update in recent months, however, is the newly released Apple Watch app. Now, the Watch app obviously isn’t going to appeal to Pokémon Go trainers who don’t own a Watch, but it may revive interest for those who do, both for wearing the Watch and playing the game. How to Set Up and Configure the Pokémon Go Watch App The Watch app is available as part of the December 22, 2016 update for iOS (version 1.21.2). So just make sure your app is updated to the latest version, and the Watch app should automatically be installed on your Watch. When you first open the app on the Watch, it will ask permission to send you notifications. You should allow it to do so or you’ll miss out an essential part of the experience. You can always change this in the Settings later. When you proceed, you will probably be greeted with a level 1 trainer screen. Don’t panic, you just need to open the Pokémon Go app on your iPhone to sync up. Indeed, when you tap “Start” on this screen, you might be greeted with a message telling you to do just that.   On your iPhone, open the Pokémon Go app. The first time you do so, you will be asked to allow the app to access your location even when you’re not using the app. Again, you’re going to want to tap “Allow”, because it will let the game to run in the background. On the surface, the Pokémon Go Watch app seems like just another way of playing the game, but it’s also a workout tracker, which means it hooks into the Health app. You can allow or disallow the app from tracking four Health metrics: Active Energy, Steps, Walking + Running Distance, and Workouts. If you allow Pokémon Go to write data, it will track progress for any or all of these metrics and write them to the Health app so you can track your progress. On the other hand, if you allow the app to read data, it will use this data for things like tracking distance walked, hatching eggs, and finding candies. Note the “Data” item on this screen as well—we’ll talk more about this below.   If hatching eggs and finding candies is important to you as a trainer, then we highly recommend you allow Pokémon Go to read and write data. You can always change these settings again later on by tapping the “Sources” tab at the bottom of the Health app and choosing “Pokémon Go”. When you tap the “Data” button mentioned earlier, you can peruse and even delete all the data Pokémon Go collects. If you tap the “Edit” button in upper-right corner (as seen in the right screenshot) you can tap on and delete individual data points.   That explains the setup process and how the Health app factors into it. If hatching eggs and collecting candies isn’t important to you, then you don’t need to allow Pokémon Go to track your steps, distance, and other items. However, if you don’t allow it access your location, the iPhone app won’t be able to run in the background, and thus you won’t be able to discover nearby Pokémon and PokéStops, which kind of defeats a lot of the app’s fun. How to Use the Pokémon Go Watch App With all the dry, boring setup stuff out of the way, it’s time to dig into the cool stuff: actually using the Pokémon Go Watch app. Once you’ve performed the setup and opened up the app on both your Watch and iPhone, you will see your trainer’s avatar, current level, and any egg or eggs you’re currently walking. Like we mentioned earlier, the Watch app is at its heart a fitness tracker and activity monitor, so when you tap “Start” it will begin tracking your steps, distance, and other metrics we mentioned in the previous section. The app consists of four screens. The Settings screen will let you turn notifications on or off for nearby Pokémon and PokéStops. Each time one or the other is nearby, your Watch will tap your wrist to notify you. If you’re out on a run or walk and you simply want to hatch eggs and collect candies, you can turn the notifications off so you won’t be bothered every time a Pidgey, Rattata, or Psyduck shows up, though you might miss out on a Pikachu! The Eggs screen will display progress for any and all eggs you’re walking. The app will also alert you when an egg is about to hatch. If you tap on the alert, it will display an animation and show you what you just hatched. If you miss this alert, you will need to check your journal on the iPhone app to see what it was.   The main app screen, and the one you will use most often, displays your progress in terms of distance walked, the time of your workout, as well as calories burned, and steps taken. The last two metrics will alternate on the display. To the right, of these numbers, you will also see your current egg or candy progress (more on this in a bit) as well as how many eggs you’re currently incubating. Finally, at the bottom of the screen, you will see up to three nearby Pokémon.   Alternately, the upper-right indicator will display your progress toward finding another piece of candy. What is displayed here seems to depend on which goal is closer. In other words, if you’re closer to hatching an egg, the egg progress indicator will display; if you’re closer to finding a piece of candy, the candy progress indicator will show. When your buddy finds a candy, the Watch will tap your wrist and let you know. To dismiss this screen, swipe up on the screen and tap “Dismiss” or simply tap lightly on the screen.   As we’ve already mentioned, the Pokémon Go Watch app will alert you (if you have notifications enabled) whenever a PokéStop or Pokémon is nearby. In the case of the latter, you can’t actually catch Pokémon with the Watch, for that, you will still need to pull your iPhone out. You can dismiss both alerts by swiping up and tapping “Dismiss” or in the case of Pokémon, simply tapping lightly on the screen.   However, you can spin PokéStops and collect items. Just tap on the PokéStop notification and spin the Stop with your finger. It will then display whatever it gives you on the screen. Tap “Close” to go back to the main app screen. Finally, the End screen will let you either pause your session (it will pause automatically just by swiping over to this screen) or end it. When you end your session, you will see a summary of your total distance, time, calories burned, steps taken, as well as any items you collected.   While people are sure to complain that you can’t catch Pokémon with the app, the fact is, you probably don’t want to. Such a feature would likely add a level of complexity (choosing different Poké Balls, Razz Berries, etc.) to the app, that it simply doesn’t need. Nor is catching Pokémon with it really the point. It functions quite well as an activity monitor, and for walking eggs and finding candies. That you can also spin PokéStops is also a nice bonus. The Pokémon alert system works fairly well, though sometimes it either seems to be behind or ahead, which means that you’ll have already walked past the Pokémon or you will have to wait for the main app to update and for them to appear. Hopefully this is just a minor performance issue that Niantic will fix in a future update. Similarly, we noticed one small issue with PokéStops: it’s pretty slow (at least on the Apple Watch Series 1, it might work more smoothly on Series 2). The point is, if you’re in an area with a lot of PokéStops, you will have to spend more time waiting to spin and collect items than you would if you just pull your iPhone out and collect items that way. Again, hopefully this is just a performance issue that a future update can address and not hardware related. Finally, if we could wish for any one feature, it would be the ability to blacklist certain Pokémon so that we don’t receive constant alerts. This is especially true when we’re out on a run or walk and our wrist is repeatedly buzzing every time a Pidgey, Rattata, or other common Pokémon appear. You can temporarily disable all alerts, of course, but then you won’t know if a good, rarer Pokémon appears. RELATED ARTICLES How to Use Pokémon Go’s New Buddy System How Pokémon Go’s New “Catch Bonus” System Works Overall, the Pokémon Go Apple Watch app is stable and fairly polished. It’s also quite feature-complete for a Watch app. One thing we particularly like is how it constantly updates egg distance progress so we always know how close we are to hatching one. It’s definitely a great tool that Pokémon trainers who own Apple Watches will appreciate and we look forward to seeing Niantic continue to improve and polish it.

The latest rumors and trends in the smartphone industry. Apple, Samsung, and a few smaller players like OnePlus have a few tricks up their sleeves. By Jake Smith for iGeneration | December 27, 2016 -- 16:00 GMT (08:00 PST) | Topic: Mobility Dual camera smartphones. (Image: file photo) A new year is around the corner, and that means a fresh crop of smartphones from the top manufacturers, like Apple and Samsung, are on the way too. Naturally, way ahead of the release of these next-generation phones, there are several reports pointing to what the devices may or may not feature. We've heard mentions of trends including curved displays, 4K screens, virtual home buttons, and wireless charging, among other things. If you want to know more about what the next high-end phones will pack, here's a look at the top five phones due out in 2017. Apple iPhone 8 Although the iPhone 7 is only a few months old, there's plenty of rumors going around about the iPhone 8, which is expected to release on the tenth anniversary of the iPhone and thought to bring a complete overhaul in design. (Image: CNET/CBS Interactive) The iPhone 7 wasn't hugely different from the iPhone 6S - or even the iPhone 6 for the matter. So, if anything, that's a huge indication that the next model will sport an all-new look, as Apple likes to switch up the iPhone's design every couple years. By the time the iPhone 8 releases, it will have been three years since Apple's decided to change how the iPhone looks. See also: Round-up of iPhone 8 rumors, if you want a reality check Some reports have suggested the iPhone 8 will be mostly glass and maybe curved. It might also introduce wireless charging and ditch the physical home button. There's also talk about a special ceramic version coming. Keep in mind Apple recently released a ceramic version of the Apple Watch Series 2. One of the most outlandish rumors so far is that there will be an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus to go alongside this drastically different iPhone 8 anniversary model - so, three new iPhones in total. Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 Edge Samsung had huge hits with the Galaxy S7 and the S7 Edge. But the company will probably have to bring a lot to the table for its follow-up to these phones, especially in light of the Note 7's battery problems and subsequent fiasco, so expect the Galaxy S8 to be extra special. (Image: CNET/CBS Interactive) Reports have suggested that Samsung might ditch the flat version of the S8, only offering curved devices in two sizes. These phones could also get a bump in screen resolution to 4K. If that's true, it'll need to pack the latest chipset for tones of power, so expect up a new, souped-up Exynos. However, we wouldn't be too surprised if we did get a Snapdragon 835 version, too. See also: Samsung Galaxy S8 reportedly features all-screen front, virtual home button There's also talk of an OLED bezel-less display, doing away with the physical home button, and more. We expect Samsung to add USB Type-C to its flagship lineup, as that seems to be the go-to standard for the best phones now. As for software, the S8 will likely launch with Nougat and TouchWiz. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is rumored to unveil on February 26, though we may get an April 2017 launch. OnePlus 5 Now that we've covered the two big dogs -- Apple and Samsung's next phones -- it's time to talk about some of the other big players in the Android space. One of the first that comes to mind is China-based OnePlus, smartphones' big disruptor. There's a rumor that OnePlus will skip the 4 number and release a OnePlus 5 in the coming year with a glass or ceramic body. (Image: file photo) The latest phone from the company is the OnePlus 3T, so if the current crops of reports are true, the next OnePlus flagship will be very different in terms of design. OnePlus isn't afraid of doing that after all -- just look at how it changed things with the OnePlus X. The phone has a dark glass back reminiscent of the glass back on the iPhone 4 So far the only other talk we've heard is that it might come with a 5.3-inch display and Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset for oodles of power. And you can expect this all to come your way in May or June 2017. ZDNet's review of the OnePlus X has more on the OnePlus' ability to provide a classy handset that's super affordable. LG G6 It's worth talking about what LG has in the works, because many people are wondering if it is going to stick with the modular approach. But first, let's talk about LG's problem with its next flagship name: G6 name is currently also used by its flagship TV. LG will likely want to change direction on phone naming, but there's no clue yet as to what we can expect. (Image: CNET/CBS Interactive) In fact, there aren't many rumors about the LG G6. It's only been suggested that LG is going to ditch the mods it introduced with the G5. Motorola offers a better alternative with the Moto Z, anyway. It's also been rumored that LG was planning a curved OLED display for the G6. Apparently, that idea was scrapped due to supply issues. We therefore suspect the next-generation LG flagship will be more simple in terms of design and functionality. The new handset will likely launch at Mobile World Congress 2017. See sister-site CNET's review of the LG G5 to learn more about why its mix-and-match design didn't quite live up to its hype. Microsoft Surface Phone This final one is a stretch, but we must include it. We could've mentioned Google's next Pixel, but there are like no rumors on that so far. And we could've brought up the next phones by HTC or Huawei, but what Microsoft is reportedly planning seems a lot more interesting. Plus, we've already discussed three other Android phones to expect in the coming year. (Image: CNET/CBS Interactive) The Surface Phone is something of an enigma. With Windows phones, we had Nokia, then Microsoft Devices, and now there's all sorts of guessing going on about a Surface-branded phone that will usher in the ultimate Windows mobile device. However, given the recent sale of many of its phone patents, and an announcement Windows Phone development isn't a major priority, the Surface Phone is seeming less and less likely. Still, Microsoft is rumored to be mulling a new Surface-branded phone for some time in 2017. However, ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley said her sources believe the company may opt to wait until 2018 to release it. When and if the phone does ever materialize, it will likely be premium, Intel-powered handset. Mounting speculation has suggested it'll come in three different variants. It'll also be made by the same team behind the Surface Tablets, so expect a solid build. There's also the suggestion that Surface Phone will run a new update of Windows 10. Other than that, the rumor mill is fairly quiet.

With that in mind we want to take you through the most important things to know about the iPad iOS 10.1.1 update as we push into December. Advertisement In early September, Apple released its iOS 10 update for select iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air and iPad mini models. The initial iOS 10 update was packed with new features and enhancements though it also brought a number of problems to the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. To address these iOS 10 problems, Apple’s rolled out several bug fix updates including an iOS 10.1.1 update for the iPad, iPad Air, iPad Pro, and iPad mini. The iPad iOS 10.1.1 update is small for those of you moving up from the iOS 10.1 update. If you’re on something old like iOS 9 or iOS 8, your iOS 10.1.1 update is going to be much larger thanks to the features and fixes from the previous versions of iOS. Bug fix updates like the iOS 10.1.1 update provide some nice benefits but they can also cause problems of their own. The iOS 10.1.1 update (surprise, surprise) is causing problems for some iPad owners and that’s part of the reason why we’ve been taking a close look at the iPad’s iOS 10.1.1 update. Advertisement This roundup offers our updated iPad iOS 10.1.1 review, a look at iPad iOS 10.1.1 problems, some details about the iOS 10.1.1 downgrade process, and details about the next iOS 10 upgrade for all four versions of the iPad. iOS 10.1.1 on iPad Review 1 / 10 We've been using the iOS 10.1.1 update on three versions of the iPad: The aging iPad mini 2, the original iPad Air, and the iPad Air 2. Since the update's release on Halloween we've focused on a few key areas including battery life, UI speed, apps/bugs/problems, and connectivity. Here's what we've found after spending five weeks with Apple's iOS 10.1.1 update. If you haven't installed iOS 10.1.1 yet not that each update took us about 10 minutes to download and install.  Advertisement We didn't run into any issues during the installation process and we haven't heard about any widespread installation issues in the weeks since the release. You should be fine but you'll want to make a backup just to be safe.  As for performance, battery life is still holding up on the iPad Air, iPad Air 2, and the iPad mini 2. We haven't noticed any abnormal drain and the updates have settled in nicely.  If you recently installed iOS 10.1.1 on your device and you're noticing issues, give the battery a couple of days to settle. It sometimes takes a day or two to adjust. If you're still running into abnormal battery drain two days after the download, you'll want to take action.  Connectivity remains strong on all three slates. We've tested the devices and their updates with several routers, ISPs, and Bluetooth devices and we haven't experienced any issues.  The iPad Air 2, iPad mini 2, and iPad Air are still handling iOS 10.1.1 well. We haven't seen any significant lag or slow down on our devices though we continue to experience occasional lag when pulling up Control Center on the iPad mini 2. We haven't seen any random reboots. If you failed to install iOS 10.1, iOS 10.1.1 is probably worth it for the security patches and bug fixes. If you're coming from something older like iOS 10.0.2, iOS 9 or iOS 8, you'll want to grab a second or third opinion before you make your move, especially if you're using an older version of the iPad. 1 / 10 110 Responses 09/30/2016 Miss L Wainwright Reply I have an iPad Air, problems since uploading new software, having to use home button more, pages freeze, when going back to home page, all apps have to be shut down otherwise I only get part of the home page. Having to do a hard shut down to get it working again. 11/03/2016 Brakus Sanja Reply After leaving my previous job 12 months ago, I’ve had some good luck to learn about this website which was a life-saver for me… They offer jobs for which people can work online from their house. My latest paycheck after working for them for 4 months was for $4500… Amazing thing about is that the only thing required is simple typing skills and access to internet.. Details atUSA Jobs Resort 09/30/2016 Fred K Reply Since installing IOS 10 and now the 10.0.2 update, mail and gmail crash unexpectedly. App updates behave strangely as well. First they continue to say Update then show the circle and then drop back to Update in the elongated circle. Also, there are continuous freezes while typing messages or running apps. You keep typing and nothing shows up on the screen. Then all of a sudden, the text you typed scrolls out on the line. Doing crosswords, the same thing occurs. The app freezes and then several boxes suddenly fill in. None of these things happened under the IOS 9 versions. The iPad also totally locks at random times required a complete forced reboot. My formerly reliable iPad 4 is no longer reliable. 09/30/2016 Jack de Golia Reply Logging on and getting past the new opening screen is a pain. The home button doesn’t always skip this screen. It takes many mashes of the button to get past this opening junk. 10/02/2016 Liz Hagan Reply I agree! This new opening screen is a pain in the butt. I hate having to tap more things just to get to the password screen. GRRRR! 10/03/2016 Myka35 Reply HAving problems just typing this up! I really don’t like the update as well. The home screen should be the easiest to get to but now it’s not. It may seem like no big deal to have to press the home button twice but considering how much you use it in the long run the wear and tear is gonna be hard. I also don’t like he bottom slide up screen, which we use a lot to stream off our iPads to appleTV. It’s now too sensitive and I don’t like how the choices are so huge now. It just doesn’t look aesthetically pleasing anymore. Shame. Why mess with something that most ppl were happy with?!?! …..my keyboard is messing up AGAIN. Grrrrrr 10/03/2016 Jonathan Spool Reply Hi, I noticed you were having keyboard problems. I have also. Sometimes random letters pop up and sections delete themselves. Is this what you were experiencing? Apple geniuses said they never saw that before, but I am on my third Ipad Pro. [email protected] 10/02/2016 P Ray Reply It is a pain. Wish I could revert to what I had. I do not want the opening screen. Give us an option to skip that. I unmarked every gadget and still takes me two tries to actually get where I used to be in the beginning. How, exactly, is this improving my life? 09/30/2016 Jim Reply Can’t stand this upgrade, specially photos. Losing total control of managing albums isn’t an upgrade, it is total disappointment. Need to have the option to deny this upgrade from managing everything and give control back to us!!! 11/05/2016 Jim Reply There’s prob more that u aren’t telling us about this shit ass down grade . What a pain in the ass 09/30/2016 Terri Reply Logging on is a nightmare. What have you done????? 09/30/2016 Dean Emelo Reply This upgrade sucks on my I pad pro 09/30/2016 Steven McCarthy Reply This upgrade sucks! Have to use home button to get to u lock PIN, when I used to be able to swipe.totally messed up the photo album app…… 09/30/2016 Kenneth McGregor Reply If I upgrade my iPad Air 2 to iOS 10 and it turns out to be a total mistake, is there any to go back? 09/30/2016 Nancy Fredrickson Reply Home screen a pain. How do you take a screen shot? The old way shuts my iPad Air 2 down. 09/30/2016 Richard Reply The upgrade to 10.0.2 sucks in my opinion as well. Have to press home button twice just to unlock the device. A bunch of crap I never asked for pops up on the screen when you first press the home button. You can access the camera without unlocking the device. Using iPad Air 2, don’t know if that’s a bug. They moved the clock to the left side of the screen. My notes page now has no lines in it I noticed that changed in one of these recent updates. My iPad and notes are harder to use. I didn’t realize Apple sends out crappy updates on occasion. I was a lot happier with the older versions. 09/30/2016 Richard Reply If Apple reads this, please bring back, one press of home button to bring up the pin lock screen and get rid of the news screen that says you have to press the home button to unlock. That change sucks big time. I want my device to have the unlock screen the second I turn it on via the home button or power button. I don’t want someone to be able to take pics, read the news, or do anything with my iPad without unlocking the device first. Add back faint lines to the notes screen to make multiple lines easier to read. It used to look like note paper. What happened to the add pages button? It’s harder to find. Notes page is too bright now. 09/30/2016 Dorothy Reply I hate the new upgrade on my Ipad pro.. simple went to difficult immediately when you have keep hitting home button. Instant messaging now has a cumbersome vol and brighness control when it should have been simple. I had to get and app to hear typing clicks.. give me a break.. the letter c does not like to work.. same as a previous upgrade that dropped the letter.. all in all I am very disappointed.. and the new versions just keep on rollin out. What is wrong with testing upgrades with a select few people b4 rolling up whT I onsider a disaster. And * haven’t even play with my photos yet. 09/30/2016 Elma de Leeuw Reply The latest update 10.0.2 sucks. The keypad hovers over the text I’m typing, so I’m not able to see if I’m making any mistakes. Before this so called update that problem wasn’t there. Now it takes me forever to type a comment/text as I have to close and reopen the keypad just to check what I’ve typed and if I made any mistakes. FIX THIS!!!!!!! 10/01/2016 Rick Davis Reply Worst update yet. 10/01/2016 Val Wilson Reply A total mess up. Toooooo many changes that are NOT helpful. 10/01/2016 gmsutton Reply My iPads won’t stay connected to my wireless router. OS x devices work so the router is not the problem. Also, it will not remember the router password. Clearing this requires multiple reboots. I’d recommend skipping this one for awhile. 10/01/2016 Patrick Reply Definitely a mistake to upgrade. Email crashes regularly to upload. Have lost the feature that links emails in a thread to allow deletions singly of earlier emails, it is now all of them or wait to get to my laptop to delete. Freezes and slowness on internet an issue. Eliminating the swipe to unlock to pressing the start button often invokes Siri. Upgrades that do not enhance are stupid, and changing what works to simply change is also dumb. Wish there was a revert feature, and will certainly avoid upgrading under trust it actually helps in the future. A big miss. Hoping to not find more disconnects elsewhere. 10/01/2016 Rick Reply In future wil not download update for atleast a month , “revert ” feature would be wonderful ! Apple dropped the Apple here. Loosing faith up updates.Really don’t like layout either. 10/01/2016 Deb Reply Hate it… my mail no longer has up and down arrows so you need to choose trash or to keep it go back to inbox each time…. not happy 10/01/2016 Phil Reply Post 10.0.2. Ipad no longer working as expected. Home key – 9 times out of ten try’s – does not unlock screen. Apple – please Bring back swipe to log in !! And get rid of 3 screens when first logging in. Please make this simple again. 10/01/2016 Dan Reply Agree with previous comments. What good are new cool features if iPad is more difficult to navigate and some games, apps are screwed up. Need a revert option also. 10/01/2016 Mike Reply iPad not secure anymore doesn’t always need pin to open if I can open it what a load of crap give me the old version back. 10/01/2016 Martin Boothman Reply Why do software updates give so much trouble? Lots of comments already so no need to say much more, but surely getting on to your device should be the simplest of tasks, yet now since latest update it is a real pain…..a “go back” button should be next update…. 10/01/2016 Tom Reply My screen shot doesn’t work after the Update.They also took away the photo stream from photos.They added many fancy features which I don’t use. Please don’t update. 10/01/2016 Robyn Reply Upgrades should improve. Why change an efficient swipe log in to a confusing page with features I don’t want and find frustrating to navigate to what I do want on my iPad. This is not an improvement 10/01/2016 Sherry singley Reply With the 10.0.2 update I can’t find how to shuffle songs. They only repeat the same song. Can anyone help with this? Thanks 10/01/2016 Pat Pugh Reply Don’t like the new upgrade. Can I go back to old one? 10/01/2016 Janet C. Reply How can i go back to the prior operating system. This one stinks on so many levels! Multiple hits on the home button ; cluttered page with all these crappy widgets i didnt ask for or need. WTF is Apple thinking? 10/01/2016 Patricia Hill Reply Not a fan of this new opening screen. I would love to know how to delete it so I can get to MY home screen with a swipe of the finger like it used to be. 10/01/2016 Barbara Reply Agree with everything everybody said. The one bonus is predictive typing and texting seem to be better. I have one question: does Apple ever ask their customers what THEY want or do they just talk to each other? (Rhetorical question) 10/01/2016 Talea Reply Bring back swipe to unlock please. It’s driving me and so many other people crazy. Also the brightness and sound settings when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen is weird. This update is one of the worst things. 10/01/2016 Kate Goldstone-James Reply Help – I want to listen to podcasts but my ipad stops broadcasting after 5 minutes. i used to be able to select “never” in the lock option, but now I can’t find it. 10/01/2016 Denise mitchell Reply Same as everyone eise, hate the new style,bring back the one swipe. 10/02/2016 Jan Reply Where has photo stream gone? Where is the search box for emails? 10/02/2016 Pat Scott Reply Hate it I can,t delete all my mail in one go now I can only do it in trash. The opening up is awful take it back to just swipe to open.why do they change without asking users. I agree with all the comments it is the worse evere I wish I had not done it. 10/02/2016 Ava Reply I still don’t get the difference 10/02/2016 Paulie Reply Can’t get FaceTime to work since the update. 10/02/2016 Diana Cox Reply Totally agree with all the frustrating negative changes. I thought I was doing something wrong about the home screen. Very confusing, unclear how to unlock. Still don,t get it. Please fix all the concerns. 10/02/2016 Karen Leckey Reply I can’t take screen shots as I used to and I use this feature a lot. If anyone works out how to do it, please let me know. I hate the log in too. I would love to be able to uninstall it. 10/02/2016 Joan Reply I can’t get to ‘open’ apps by pressing the home button twice like I used to. How do I shut an app down? 10/02/2016 P. Mccarthy Reply The 10.0.2 is the WORST had over 2000 songs in my library now I less than 1000 not sure where they went email keeps blanking out you would think apple would test this before unleashing this horror on customers!!!!!!! Not Happy at all 10/02/2016 E Potter Reply Useless. I have 2 email accounts and can now only access one of them 10/02/2016 Barbara Kelly Reply Sucks is an understatement. Need an option to go back. Considering losing the Ipad. No longer fun like it was when I got it. Finally learned it and then “improvements” like this happen. This is by far the worst yet! 10/02/2016 Paul Antico Reply With the very consistent negative experiences of this upgrade expressed here, why doesn’t the author address these issues in a followup or update to this article? I will not be updating anytime soon based on these comments, regardless of the article’s more neutral to favorable review of said update. 10/02/2016 Cindy Haddock Reply If anyone figures out how to revert to the previous version please let me know. This one stinks and has totally screwed up everything I had (and liked) on my ipad. 10/02/2016 Zenon Kolacz Reply Likewise! My iPad Air 2 us now stuffed! 10/02/2016 MikeO Reply Had a major problem following the upgrade. My iPad 4 got stuck in FaceTime mode. Following a FT session and long after the other party disconnected, my ipad continued to show disconnecting. Apparently this continued for over an hour as I had set my iPad down and went outside. Upon returning the iPad had lost 50 percent battery power and the iPad was noticeably hot. I could not get FT to quit or get the FT window to close, even by double clicking home and up-swiping the window. I had to do a hard shutdown and reboot to close the FT program. 10/02/2016 Nick Reply Someone please post how to uninstall this latest update, it sucks!!!!! 10/02/2016 ZCLUB Katie Joy Reply I agree! Want to uninstall this. I never write comments but I’m so upset with this upgrade. I can’t believe the hassle to just log in. I’m shocked Apple would make like harder for us instead of easier. Bring back Steve Jobs! Is this the beginning of Apple demise … 10/03/2016 Myka35 Reply YEs! I came here as well after getting so frustrated with the upgrade I was wondering if I was the only one! See how my first two letters are capital? Well, that’s because the keyboard seems to lag….a lot. Not liking this at all. I post all the time on my iPad so this is going to get old QUICK. And don’t even get me started with the whole ‘having the push the home button twice to open’ thing. Ugh! So annoying. Why can’t apple actually ASK their customers if we WANT to see these kind of changes in an upgrade? I’d be happy to give them my input beforehand to keep this from happening again anytime soon. And we have three iPads, MacBook Pro, 27″ iMac, and two iPhones! Grrrrrr! 10/02/2016 Leonard Smith Reply I Now have to push my home button twice to enter my password for my iPad. Is there anyway I can delete 10.0.2? 10/02/2016 hp Reply hate it, slow, crashes, extra steps all of the above!!!!!! 10/03/2016 Lorraine Reply Glad to see I’m not the only person that is struggling with this log on in the supposed upgrade. Really wish we could return to previous system. 10/03/2016 Shaishannah Reply I agree with all the above comments…I HATE IT!! Just getting into my iPad is a nightmare, I have an anxiety disorder so this update has added to that so thanks (not) apple! FFS!!!! I’m going to find out if I can change back…Anyone else know? Pleeeaaasssee! 10/03/2016 Arnold Reply My “Jigsaw puzzle” is as slow as an old mole after the upgrade from 10.0.1 to 10. 0.2. Would love to go back to previous version. 10/03/2016 Louise Reply Dear Apple, I generally LOVE your designs! But this new 10.0.2 version is UGLY! The BLACK CLOCK made me say “gross!” and the new overly enhanced emojis look ugly and non-elegant!!!!!!! And the worst part is, I can’t even go back! Bring the lighter clock back!!! What’s wrong with you guy – you always hired good designers before! This is DEFINITELY a change for the WORSE!!!! Your user for 10+ years. 10/03/2016 Debra Reply Cannot get rid of junk mail, ‘unable to move messages into the mailbox trash’. Don’t like the noise when typing or the log on process. Only updated last night so I hope I don’t find anymore problems. Wish I had read all these comments first! 10/03/2016 Phil Reply Apple you jerks, start up is the beginning of the problems. 10/03/2016 Karen Reply I agree absolutely hate it. I already have a faulty home button and now have to use it more. 10/03/2016 Vicki Reese Reply I agree with what everyone has said. I have an ipad, iphone, macbook and I wish I never did this update. This update is a piece of junk and Apple, you suck big time. 10/03/2016 Kate Reply The opening screen is a major pain. Also I can’t search mail anymore. Battery drain is an issue. I have an iPad Air 2. 10/03/2016 Miguel Reply This software update is horrible. You take a simple user friendly gesture such as swipe to unlock and completely remove that from the interface. Now I have to press the home button twice to unlock my screen. I use a bluetooth keyboard and now I have to press any key twice instead of once. Simply ridiculous. Its like Apple wants your devices to break quicker. Makes me never want to update again. Secondly why do you keep applying updates like every week? If it’s not broken don’t fix it. Keep it simple and stop changing things. Revert your opening screen back to the way it was in the previous software. You made things more difficult and less user friendly. 10/03/2016 Jeff Reply Dang! LOST all notes. Restore does not restore them. Anyone else experience? 10/03/2016 tony s Reply This is crap, its as simple as that. What prat did this. 10/04/2016 Alex Ward Reply List of email accounts has been formatted. Each account now showing with inbox, sent, etc., all displayed. Have to telescope them to avoid seeing all of them all the time. Any way to revert to previous email account display? 10/04/2016 Richard Dean Reply Cannot see the text of received email. Cannot type with touchpad; the touchpad keyboard covers what I’m typing. The touchpad should be at bottom of screen but it in the middle – space above and below. Cannot move the touchpad keypad. THIS IS A TERRIBLE UPGRADE (10.0.2). Its practically destroyed my iPad. 10/05/2016 Kathleen Reply This is the worst update I have ever done! I can’t get to my home screen unless I type “home” in the search bar, if I can get to the search bar! Talk about frustrating! I’ve removed all the widgets, I don’t want all that crap to come up before my home screen… they need to fix this immediately! 10/05/2016 Patricia Miller Reply My email accounts are messed up!!!!! Wish I had never updated!!!! 10/06/2016 John Scott Reply Thanks for your reviews. I did the update on my iPhone , hated it. Will not update my iPad . 10/06/2016 Sharon Reply First World Problem, but l lost my ‘edit’ button in photos. I neeeeeed that button! Where is it???? Anybody? 10/06/2016 Mike 55 Reply Every negative comment is correct. This is not something you get use to. Everything is twice as hard. And you just can’t do something like remove screen shot! I am sure it’s in the find print of what ever I agreed to but that is bull! 10/07/2016 Ann Marie Reply Hate your update. Are you trying to drive us all to Samsung. Don’t want the Clinton news network updates when I turn on my phone. Terrible job apple 10/07/2016 Shahid khan Reply I update iPad mini 10/07/2016 Cindy.

I nearly smash it through the otherside. Shocking update 10/07/2016 Od Reply Ugh! Hate it! The extra step to log in, and the mess of all my emails being amalgamated–not one “upgrade” I wanted! I’m ready to buy a frigging exploding Samsung over this uber-control. 10/07/2016 Jim Spalla Reply Logging on is cumbersome, itunes podcasts quit downloading and music videos are no longer in the videos app but were moved to the music app. I have been trying to fix the the podcast issue but to no avail. 10/07/2016 Morne Reply What a disaster I can’t make calls receive calls, frozen half the time keep, having to re enter my pin, camera don’t show options on pic images.

What did adding that step accomplish? 10/13/2016 Catdaddy Reply Totally agree it sucks and the news pages that pop up are for the Hilary lovers 10/13/2016 Beth K Reply Agree about home screen log on. Haven’t had time to find out about other things mentioned that suck but nice to have a heads up. Battery crapped down much faster than before and what really tweaks me is no sleep mode when cover is closed=dead iPad when I wake up late for work because no power=no alarm. If there is a way to go back to older version I’m in. Thanks. 10/13/2016 Heather Chalmers Reply If you have an iPad, do NOT do this update. I stumble when trying to get into the damn thing. Apple needs to learn that if something is not broken, it doesn’t need to be fixed. My typing sound/tone has also changed and it’s driving me nuts. This was a stupid move on Apple’s part. 10/14/2016 Steve Reply Email crashes about every 2 minutes. Agree with other comments about pressing home button twice. This upgrade is downgrade to me! Sucks. 10/14/2016 Jill Reply I thought it was just me – this is anything but an upgrade. I was going for an iphone7 but not with this awful system I’m not. I want to revert to the previous OS as soon as someone figures how. even the keyboard sounds have been changed and now sound awful. Cheap and nasty. If this persists I’m going android. Shame about the note7. 10/15/2016 Marie Watson Reply I have to agree with ALL of the above comments! The main thing I want to know at this point is how to un-install this software upgrade. All the instructions on-line do not work and I am frustrated at this point. I use my phone for everything! Please let me know if someone figures this out! Thanks :) 10/16/2016 Dan Reply This upgrade is a downgrade. It’s harder to open and i can’t take a screenshot on my iphone. This programmer should be fired. I think I’d rather have a Samsung exploding in my pocket. 10/16/2016 MVP Reply Is anyone else having problems with videos not playing correctly? Since I installed the upgrade I have sound, but no picture. Is there a fix for this? 10/16/2016 Kat Reply Hate the update, agree with everyone. How do I take a screenshot? 10/17/2016 Jill Reply Agree with all comments about opening screen. I don’t want to have to press the home button twice as often as this will halve its life and the alternative route is a lot of faffing about compared to what was a simple intuitive process (which is what I thought Apple were all about). I don’t need Apple’s suggestions as to what I might want to look at thanks, I’m quite capable of deciding that for myself. Poorly thought out design. 10/17/2016 Lucy Reply I want to uninstall this upgrade can some one help please 10/17/2016 Barbie Reply Totally agree!!!! Tried to uninstall it and doesn’t show up on my list … it said to go to settings… general…. storage… manage storage and it would show up on my apps list but it didn’t… so if I can’t find it on the list then I cannot delete it… someone please help😏 10/19/2016 Todd Reply Seems making us press the home button is going to make it wear out faster meaning we have to replace our tablets sooner. And besides it slows down me getting on my way to the areas I want to explore. 10/21/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply my touch id doesnt work – this damn ios10 messed up my phone 11/25/2016 Bianca Beyer Reply I declined thousands of times.

Whether it was Nintendo in the 80s or the iPhone 6 in 2014, each new generation seems to have a better grasp of technology. So how do you stay one step ahead of your kids and make sure they're not being exposed to inappropriate content? The answer: parental controls. Luckily, both Apple and Google are well-aware of the problem and have provided ample tools to protect your kids (and to make sure they don't rack up hundreds of dollars in in-app purchases). Here we explain how to set up those controls on both Android and iOS devices:​  (Photo: Flickr user "Yuri Yu. Samoilov") Android Parental Controls Google's OS only has parental controls built in for tablets, but it does have decent controls for all devices in the Google Play Store. If you go into the store's settings, you will find a Parental Controls menu. It's off by default and requires you to create a four-digit PIN when you turn it on. Once you've created a PIN, you will be able to decide which content ratings are acceptable for your kids, and the Play Store will only display content within those ratings. Unfortunately, you can't shut off in-app purchases, but you can require a password for all purchases. To enable passwords for every purchase, tap on "Require authentication for purchases" under the Play Store's settings menu. This will bring up a prompt asking you to select whether you want to require authentication for every purchase, every 30 minutes, or never. By default, it should be set for every purchase, but you should check to be sure. Get the latest deals, news and reviews from Reviewed.com Email Address As for tablet parental controls, these center around an Android feature called "restricted profiles." Unlike on iPads, Android tablets allow you to set up multiple user accounts, or profiles, similar to computers. To set up a restricted profile, go into the Android Settings app, tap on Users, tap "Add user or profile," and finally tap "Restricted profile." From here, you can set content restrictions and even shut off access to specific apps. Just make sure that you've also set up Play Store parental controls, as well as put a password on your personal user profile. The last thing you want is for your child to use your unrestricted account to access content they shouldn't be seeing. This is as far as Android goes when it comes to parental controls, but if you want even tighter controls over your kids' phones you can use powerful third-party apps thanks to the open nature of Android. The Internet Safety Project has a list of apps for monitoring, filtering, and tracking usage. There are even anti-sexting and anti-cyberbullying features. However, the one app that seems to do it all, according to the list, is MobileMinder Parental Control.  (Photo: Apple) iOS Parental Controls While Android probably takes the crown when it comes to managing storage space, Apple's iOS has far better parental controls. It includes granular controls for pretty much everything, even the ability to delete an installed app. All of these controls are broken into two separate features of the OS: Restrictions and Family Sharing. Restrictions This feature is buried within the iOS Settings, but the amount of control it gives you is incredible. You can do everything from shut off cellular data to block use of the built-in camera. To set up Restrictions, go to Settings > General > Restrictions. It will immediately ask you to create a four-digit PIN, after which you can define exactly what restrictions you want. Once you've set up a PIN, you can shut off access to the iTunes and App Stores, prevent in-app purchases, set content ratings, block certain websites, and even prevent your kids from changing their phones' privacy settings. You will probably find that a lot of the restrictions are unnecessary, but it's certainly nice to have the options. You can never be too safe. Family Sharing Let's say you've set up Restrictions, but you still want to give your kids the ability to purchase apps. Instead of coming to you with their phones and asking you to enter your password for each purchase, you can set up Apple Family Sharing, a new feature introduced with iOS 8. While this feature has a number of different functions, the best is the way it handles purchases for your family. Apple notes that all purchases are made with the same credit card, but they are siloed off for each member of the family, preventing your iPhone from filling up with apps you didn't download, like your kids' latest games. Perhaps the best part of Family Sharing is the "Ask to Buy" feature. If you set this up on your kids' devices, all of their purchase requests will be routed to your phone, presenting a notification where you can either allow or deny the purchase. And if you decide you want to download the app as well, you can access their purchases to download it yourself. REVIEWED The Best Smartphones of 2016 - Reviewed.com Smartphones Family Sharing also allows you to keep tabs on your kids' locations via the Find My Friends app, as well as the locations of their devices with the Find My iPhone app. To set up Family Sharing, go into the Settings app on your iPhone (not your kid's) and tap iCloud. You will see a button that says "Set up Family Sharing," which will walk you through the process. According to Apple, once you add family members via their Apple IDs, they will receive invitations to join your family group. If your kids are under the age of 13, Apple now allows you to make Apple IDs for them, which you can do by going back into your iCloud settings, tapping Family, and then hitting "Create an Apple ID for a child." Once you've set up Family Sharing, Apple explains how you can enable Ask to Buy on your kids' devices by going to Settings > iCloud > Family, then selecting a family member and tapping "Ask to Buy." With all of these different features, you should be able to lock down your kids' devices to uncrackable levels. They may be a bit frustrated by it all, but at least you can keep them safe online and avoid costly bills from the App Store.

Here’s how to cope, for the least amount of money. By Emily Bary Dec. 27, 2016 10:56 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large ENLARGE Illustration: Pixabay Did you get a new MacBook Pro for the holidays? If so, you might be surprised by how few of your Apple accessories actually fit into the new computer. Get ready to embrace dongles, the term for those converter plugs that bridge the gap between old and new devices. For Apple devotees, the dongle talk brings back memories of 2012. That’s when Apple changed over to the Lightning cable for iPhones and iPads, sending us scrambling for new charging cords and adapters that would prevent our old docks from becoming obsolete. This year, folks who got latest Apple products are in for a double whammy -- iPhone and laptop changes. The new MacBook Pro – launched in November -- dumped all the ports you actually use (USB, HDMI, and SD card) in favor of fancy new “Thunderbolt/USB-C” ports. Your old charger won’t work, but that’s not such a big deal. The real problem is that absolutely no cord you use right now connects via USB-C, even your trusty iPhone cable. More Barron’s Next Technology Stories Apple Accessories: When to Save, When to Splurge The Only Two Streaming TV Options You Need 6 Tips to Save Your Holiday Deliveries The latest move extends the cord confusion surrounding the iPhone 7, which famously launched in September without a headphone jack. So now you can’t charge and listen to music at the same time. Plus your old headphones aren’t directly compatible. Apple seems to be feeling a little guilty about all the changes because it’s temporarily cut the prices on many of its dongles. To make your new laptop compatible with older devices, you’ll still have to fork over $9 to Apple to get its USB-C to USB adapter (discounted at $9 “for a limited time”) or its “multiport” adapter that converts one USB-C port into an HDMI, USB, and USB-C port all at the same time ($49, also on sale). Since Apple’s standard Lightning cables don’t have USB-C connection, you can buy one that does for $19. But we’re all about saving money on Apple accessories. For example, you can get two USB-C to USB adapters for the price of one Apple one ($9) from Aukey through Amazon. CableCreation’s USB-C to HDMI adapter, sold through Amazon, will set you back $14. If you use SD cards often, RicoRich makes a USB-C to SD slot adapter for $11. Combined, this’ll cost you less than Apple’s own “discounted” multiport adapter, even with the SD slot, which isn’t part of Apple’s model. To help you get over the loss of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple gave you headphones that connect through the Lightning port, as well as a dongle that makes your existing headphones Lightning compatible. If you want duplicates, you’ll have to shell out $29 for the headphones themselves and $9 for the “dongle.” You can do a little better than that. Save a buck with Wopow’s Lightning headphone adapter ($8) or pay 60 more cents than what Apple’s charging and get an adapter that lets you charge and listen to music at the same time. How novel.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley Look Ahead: Measure V vote, Yucca Loma Bridge and closed fire stations on the radar for 2017 Monday Dec 26, 2016 at 3:48 PM Dec 26, 2016 at 3:48 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — What will 2017 bring in the Town of Apple Valley? Here are five things that will be on the horizon in the new year. Measure V vote The town’s takeover attempt of Liberty Utilities, Apple Valley produced an onslaught of punch, counterpunch scenarios in 2016, with both sides assuming the offensive when openings presented themselves. In June, Liberty officials disclosed to the Daily Press the town’s unauthorized use of 869,000 gallons of company water on the Apple Valley Golf Course, a move that ran up a nearly $7,000 bill and led to criticism of the town’s ability to safely run a water system. And in October, Liberty’s General Manager Tony Penna let fly an ireful outburst directed at Councilor Curt Emick during a meeting that culminated with Penna’s removal from Council chambers and town officials calling his comments a threat of physical violence. Yet these incidents, though providers of intriguing fodder, were mere jabs in the grand scheme; never would either decide the future water provider in Apple Valley. Voters’ passage of Measure V on Nov. 8, however, carries the potential to significantly impact a future purchase, should the town win its eminent-domain case. If voters opt against the bond debt, the town will be forced to — at the very least — look elsewhere for financing. It’s unknown when the vote will occur; town officials say more discussion is required by the Council before a date is set. But with a trial setting conference scheduled for Jan. 7 — and litigation expected to move forward thereafter — 2017 could be the year of a vote on debt. Yucca Loma Bridge opening While work on the third and final phase of the Yucca Loma Corridor remains at least two years away, town officials celebrated completion of the Yucca Loma Bridge in 2016, over two years after construction commenced. And with widening work on the nearby Yucca Loma Road progressing ahead of schedule, 2017 will mark the long-anticipated opening of the bridge to traffic. The tentative schedule includes a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 19 and a community bike ride on May 20 before the opening on May 22. Because Victorville’s Green Tree Boulevard Extension project is still in design, it’s unlikely the opening will alleviate congestion along Bear Valley Road or Highway 18 in the short term. Still, the opening will be seen as a major accomplishment given that officials have talked of a bridge over the Mojave River since the 1960s, according to former Victorville City Councilman Ryan McEachron. Reopening of closed fire stations Funds provided by Measure A — the fire tax voters overwhelmingly passed in November — won’t be available until July, but 2017 could be the year two closed fire stations reopen. Apple Valley Fire Protection District Chief Sid Hultquist previously told the Daily Press the reopenings of stations 336 and 337 are “going to happen,” but he stopped short of providing a date. Staffing plans will be prepared in the interim, as the district’s board develops “timelines with the logistics needed to open” the stations that closed following the Great Recession. Hilltop House More than seven months have passed since the town officially took ownership of Newt Bass’ Hilltop House, but officials have been relatively quiet about future plans for the site outside of its eventual inclusion into the Parks and Recreation system. Per grant-program requirements, the town has three years from the acquisition date to create an “outdoor recreational opportunity for the public’s benefit,” so 2017 could be the year an ad hoc committee is formed to discuss what sort of recreational attraction the house will become. New year, new captain The promotion of San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department Capt. Lana Tomlin to deputy chief of all desert region stations will signal the return of Capt. Frank Bell to town next month. Bell previously worked as lieutenant at the Apple Valley Sheriff’s station before moving to headquarters in San Bernardino where he served as captain of the Employee Resources Unit. He will assume the captain role after Tomlin makes her own transition to headquarters on Jan. 21. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

The process usually starts with a single Google search page and ends up with multiple tabs, maybe spread across multiple windows, with snippets of useful information scattered across different web pages. There’s no way you’re going to remember all of that, which is where Apple’s bundled Mac and iOS Notes app comes in Should You Be Using Apple's Notes for iOS and OS X? Should You Be Using Apple's Notes for iOS and OS X? For the first time since its release, Apple Notes for both OS X and iOS may be worth considering. Read More . This free tool can be an indispensable research aid on both a computer and mobile device. Here’s how to put it to good use, and a few alternatives you can turn to instead. Why Apple Notes? Many users often disregard the built in Apple apps, and I’m guilty of that myself. But some apps like the Safari browser, and Photos app are actually top-notch. Ever since the iOS 9 update, the Notes app has joined the list. In that update, the Notes app gained much needed formatting support, image markup, a sketching feature, and Share sheet extensions. And with each update, it’s picked up new tricks, including locked notes and collaboration feature. Best of all, iCloud sync for notes between multiple Apple devices actually works! That gives me confidence that Apple is determined to support and improve the app. Apple Notes itself is a very simple notetaking tool. You can’t even create subfolders or add tags on iOS but what it does do, it does well. And while Evernote might flip-flop on its strategy 3 times a year The Best Alternatives to Evernote You Need Today The Best Alternatives to Evernote You Need Today Has Evernote's recent price increase and two-device restriction for the free plan disturbed your note-taking workflow? Then, it's time to take another look at some of the best Evernote alternatives. Read More , changing its pricing policy and interface, limiting features when they see fit, there’s none of that with Apple Notes. It’s the simple and barebones nature which makes Apple Notes so useful 10 Tips to Get the Most out of Apple Notes on OS X 10 Tips to Get the Most out of Apple Notes on OS X Have you switched over to Apple's vastly improved Notes app? Here are a few tips on improving your workflow. Read More . There’s no need to install an extension that might be buggy or too heavy. There’s no need to deal with the complicated interface of a full-fledged research tool. There’s no uphill battle against the UI. To compare and contrast with Evernote, you can only use the service on two devices for free and there’s no offline support on mobile devices either. Of course Evernote has a kitchen sink worth of features, integration with other services, and the lion’s share of users. But for most people out there, Notes will serve as a quick, always-there, and easy way of collecting and organizing information from the web. It’s also great for assembling research on any topic. Using Apple Notes as a Research Tool First, you’ll need to make sure that you’re using iOS 9 and above on your iPhone or iPad, and OS X El Capitan or above on your Mac. You should also make sure that iCloud sync for Notes is enabled on all your devices, under iCloud settings. Then, assuming that a bulk of your researching takes place on the Mac, you really should be using Safari. Because of the Share sheet integration. If you’re a Chrome user, you’re left out in the cold, as there’s no extension for you. You’ll need to resort to the classic “copy, switch to Notes, paste” drill. But for Safari users, things are much much easier. Say you’re on a web page that has useful information about the topic and you want to save it. Just highlight the text, right-click, select Share and then Notes. You’ll see a popup with the selected text right there. Select the note you want to save it in, or create a new note. Click on Save and it’s done. Want to save the link to the page you’re currently on? Click the Share button from Safari’s toolbar, click on Notes, add some text if you want, select the note and hit Save. When you go to the Notes app you’ll find a nice preview of the link, including the title of the page, a short description, and the feature image. This visual link preview will be really helpful later on, when you’re browsing through the note, trying to find that one link. You can save images as well, using the same right click, Share > Notes method. When you save the image, Notes will also save the link from where it came from, right below (super helpful). Once the image is in the Notes app, you can mark it up as well (right click on the image in the Notes app and select Markup). It works similarly on iOS. When you’re a webpage you want to save, just hit the Share button, select Add to Notes, select the note from the popup and hit Save. You can also highlight text in Safari, Mail, or other apps, hit Share followed by Add to Notes and specify where you want the content saved. The Notes extension on iOS is available across the majority of your apps because by now, the Share sheet is basically everywhere, including various reading apps and alternative browsers, making it really easy to send links and other content to the Notes app. A Few Drawbacks Now, let’s talk about the downsides of simplicity. When you highlight some text and share it to the Notes app on Mac, it won’t include the source link for where the text came from (a lot of “smart” research tools like Mammoth do this). On iOS, there’s a weird bug (at least I hope it’s a bug), where if you select an entire paragraph of say, four sentences, the contextual menu won’t show the “Share” button. But if you select, say, two sentences, you’ll be able to “Share” the text directly to the Notes app using the extension, without copy/pasting. This means that if you’re going to be using your iPhone to research a lot, you’ll need to copy and paste text instead (which deters a bit from the sophistication of the Mac app). You can still highlight and copy text, hit the Share button then Add to Notes and paste your copied text into the box to save both a link and some page content. Hopefully Apple will fix this in a future iOS update. Alternative Research Aids It’s totally possible that for various reasons (for instance, the impossibility of switching from Chrome to Safari on Mac), might keep you from the Notes app. Maybe the simplicity of the Notes app just isn’t for you, and you need more. There are a couple of solutions for you. Mammoth — Mammoth is a powerful research tool masquerading as a collaboration-heavy notetaking tool. It’s the Chrome extension that’s the real winner. Once activated, it shows up as a sidebar. You can drag and drop text, images or links into a note and add comments to everything you add, to give you context. Mammoth also has apps for iPhone and Android so you can use the same Share sheet integration to send content to the app. The app is free for personal use, with unlimited boards and participants and storage up to 5 GB. If you want more, you can pay $3.99 per month for 50 GB storage, document preview, and unlimited file uploads. Gistnote Highlighter — Another Chrome extension that makes it really easy to track important information by highlighting it. Once you’ve highlighted stuff using different colors on different pages, you can use the “Collections” feature to organize it. Use an alternate, cross-platform notetaking app — These days, it’s difficult to go a week without a new notetaking tool showing up in the App Store charts. And you can use a cross-platform notetaking tool like Simplenote, Evernote, or OneNote to accomplish something similar. If you want to stay in the Apple universe, check out the newly released Bear app. If you’re a Chrome person and you’re ready to adopt a new, albeit complex system for researching, check out the best extensions we’ve lined up here Turn Chrome Into a Research Hub With These Extensions Turn Chrome Into a Research Hub With These Extensions The Internet is a wonderful resource for students, but these Chrome extensions can make the process of finding, marking up, organizing, and citing information a million times easier. Read More . Another Use for Notes: A Link Bucket The current state of bookmarking tools isn’t that great. I’ve personally tried to use two new tools — Raindrop and Stash — but nothing sticks. I’ll just end up going back to Pinboard, yet again (but I find it difficult to recommend Pinboard to most people, because of its almost non-existent UI). If you’re the kind of person who’s not satisfied with the built-in bookmark manager in your browser and you think third party solutions are either too convoluted or organized in a way that doesn’t make sense to you, try using the Notes app as a link bucket. Because the Notes app adds link preview for every page you drop in, it makes it really easy to save and organize links in different notes. And as they’re just text links underneath, it’s really easy to go in, rearrange and delete links later. Whether it’s for research purposes, or simply for organizing your favorites. You should give it a shot. Do You Use Apple Notes? Apple Notes isn’t for everyone, but it’s received quite the overhaul in recent years which makes it a much more viable tool than when it first appeared. Formatting, markup, a proper Mac client, and the recently improved text size in the Mac app 11 macOS Sierra Things You Couldn't Do in El Capitan 11 macOS Sierra Things You Couldn't Do in El Capitan Every new macOS release introduces new tricks and features, and macOS Sierra is no exception.

Can easily then look at them on my Mac and toggle back and forth between the 2 devices. Writing with Notes is almost like using a notebook. For more complex things such as those listed above, I actually prefer Evernote, which is just more elegant and versatile. Reply Khamosh Pathak December 27, 2016 at 6:39 pm For simple stuff, Notes makes a lot of sense. Evernote has been great for managing more complicated things as it supports Tags, has a superior search feature and a lot of integrations. But because Evernote as a company isn't doing great, it's becoming less and less sensible (and possible) to keep using the app. Between the pricing changes, feature cutbacks in free tier and the latest policy change, Evernote as a notetaking tool just doesn't make sense for a lot of people.

But if Apple’s built-in security features and encryption just aren’t enough for you — or you don’t trust the company to keep your communications private — you have another, much more expensive option. It’s called the “K iPhone,” and it manufacturer says it’s the go-to choice for military personal, heads of state, and anyone who values their privacy. Don't Miss: Major torrent sites are offline thanks to mysterious cyber attacks The K iPhone is made by KryptAll, which sells several different pieces of encrypted communications gear, from the aforementioned Apple smartphone to a mobile broadband satellite communicator that can produce a cellular signal anywhere on the planet. KryptAll says its modified iPhone utilizes modified components, a custom firmware, and the company’s own VoIP app to make end-to-end encrypted phone calls to anyone in the world. But while it can make calls to any number, it can only take incoming calls from other KryptAll devices, to ensure security. The company says that phone calls made of its encrypted network cannot be tapped or tracked, and that not oven KryptAll has any way of knowing the details of the calls. The company’s guidelines for law enforcement describes it thusly: KryptAll provides VoIP audio calls that are secured by encryption. KryptAll is a zero knowledge system as calls are not stored on the server network and calling records are not generated. The KryptAll phone can make calls; however, cannot receive KryptAll calls unless it is from another KryptAll phone. We do not have a history or copies of calls exchanged by anybody on the system. We do not have the decryption keys thus we cannot intercept any of the calls sent through KryptAll. KryptAll does not assign or control IP the address. It’s super secure, but the K iPhone can also be used just like any other iPhone, and downloading apps and other common smartphone functions perform just as you’d expect. The company, which has been selling its encrypted devices for just a couple of years now, says it already has some extremely important clientele, including “privacy advocates” and executives from Rolls-Royce, Maybach, and other companies. That makes a lot of sense, because in order to afford one of these custom iPhones you’ll definitely need a pretty healthy paycheck. The devices, which the company sells on eBay for some reason, are several thousands of dollars each, and the current price of the iPhone 7 version is over $4,500.

A new report from Japanese blog Macotakara supports this by claiming Apple will add a third variation to the iPhone lineup. It says Apple plans to introduce a 5-inch iPhone this fall. The report, which cites an unnamed Taiwanese supplier, says that the 5-inch iPhone will be identical in terms of specs to the “iPhone 7s” and “iPhone 7s Plus.” It claims that the 5-inch will feature a dual-camera design similar to the Plus models, but will be placed vertically versus the current horizontal design. With the 5-inch model reportedly being identical to the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, it’s likely that Apple plans on extending the line rather than replacing a previous model. Though it’s totally possible that this 5-inch model will replace the 4.7-inch model if Apple plans on reducing the bezels and retaining the same form factor. Details regarding an “iPhone 7s” are very scarce. Most reports are pointing towards the “iPhone 8” which could be a single model this year. It’s been widely reported that this model will feature the OLED display and an all glass design, while the 4.7 and 5.5-inch models (the ones we know now) will be iterative updates.

Breaking News Cameron Crowe On 20th Anniversary Of 'Jerry Maguire': Q&A Top Stories Deadline’s Best Movies & New TV Shows Of 2016 – Watch Film ‘Twin Peaks’ Sundance Sneak Before Showtime Debut? by by David Lieberman International ‘Sherlock’ Cast & Creators On Twist In Season 4 Premiere by by David Lieberman Business Remembering Those We Lost In Cruel 2016: Photo Gallery by by David Lieberman Business Big Media Count On Donald Trump To Jolt The Economy & Encourage Dealmaking by David Lieberman December 26, 2016 3:33pm 7 Business Breaking News Corporate Affairs Media News Best of 2016 Big Media REX/Shutterstock It’s easy to predict what will happen to the TV and movie businesses in 2017. Just figure out what Donald Trump will do as president and how that will affect the economy and regulation. Related Big Media Hope To Overcome Wall Street's Cord-Cutting Fears In 2016 OK, so it’s not so easy. The media execs who helped to make Trump a national celebrity are as unsure as everyone else about what he’ll do as president. Yet, strangely, they and their investors – most of whom opposed him in their non-corporate lives — are optimistic. Rex/Shutterstock The Dow Jones U.S. Media Index is up 8.6% since the election (as of December 20), ahead of the S&P 500, which is up 6.1%. Before the election, the Media Index was +4.2%, lagging the S&P’s +4.7%. Optimists expect the economy generally, and advertising specifically, to benefit from a Keynesian jolt — even if it runs up the government deficit. Businesses and consumers should have more to spend if the administration and Republican-led Congress cut taxes, increase spending for defense and the infrastructure and leave most entitlements alone, the thinking goes. They also believe that Trump will cozy up to traditional media companies, despite his tirades against their journalists and satirists. Investors made that bet by bidding up stock prices for many of the largest newspaper and broadcast companies including Sinclair, Tegna, the New York Times and Gannett: Each was down by double-digit percentages this year before the election and up by double digits since then. RelatedHow Will Trump Change Media? Here Are Potential Losers And Winners That mostly reflects Wall Street’s belief that we’ll see a wave of deals after the new administration and a GOP-controlled FCC allow a single entity to own a major TV station as well as the dominant newspaper in the same market. Similarly, cable and telco stocks have surged since the election in the belief that Trump’s FCC will reverse tech-industry supported initiatives – notably strong net neutrality protections. REX/Shutterstock What about Trump’s threat to kill AT&T’s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner? It will be too hard for his Justice Department to square that with their relaxed antitrust views, the conventional wisdom holds. If these assumptions are correct, then the new administration will create a verdant environment for additional mergers. As Time Warner showed, it’s a good time to bail out: Big Media companies make most of their profits from pay TV but haven’t overcome the cord-cutting fears that chilled Wall Street in mid-2015. This year promises to be especially disruptive as digital services including AT&T’s DirecTV Now, Hulu Live, a planned service from Google – and who knows what from Apple and Amazon – challenge traditional pay TV. Meanwhile, movie execs are waiting to see if studios lock horns with exhibitors over whether new releases should also be available to home viewers. RelatedWarner Bros. Chief Says It’s “Imperative” To Offer New Movies To Home Viewers; Two-Week Window Eyed Anyone who remembers the ashen looks on the faces of political forecasters on Election Night will appreciate that it’s treacherous to make predictions involving Trump – as well as the state of the nation, including the media business. With all that in mind, here are a few questions industry insiders ponder as they look to 2017: What will happen to U.S. relations with China? Hollywood has every reason to worry about Trump’s tough talk about having China classified as a currency manipulator — and possibly launching a trade war. The U.S. movie market appears topped out. That’s why studios salivate over the opportunity to expand in the world’s No. 2 market. China’s box office sales grew 48% in 2015 and are up 325% since 2010. Meanwhile, Chinese companies are investing heavily in Hollywood. Dalian Wanda Group led the pack with acquisitions of AMC Entertainment — the world’s largest exhibition chain — and this year’s pickup of Legendary Entertainment and dick clark productions. RelatedDonald Trump, Chinese President Talk, Communist Paper Lashes Out: How Will Hollywood-China Relationship Fare? So expect a lot of nail biting in February when the U.S. renegotiates China’s film-importation quota. Officially the country allows just 34 foreign films in per year, though it agreed to accept close to 40 in 2016. And bankers in Hollywood might see the pool of potential investors dry up if the U.S. government looks askance at China’s growing clout over pop culture — or Beijing decides it’s time to do business elsewhere. RelatedHollywood & China: Wanda Again In U.S. Gov’t Crosshairs; Who’s Pushing The Hot Button? Will over-the-top cannibalize cable? Media execs say that OTT — the clunky name for cable-like streaming video services — will strengthen the status quo by appealing to the 20 million or so households that don’t subscribe to pay TV. That’s been the experience they’ve had with Dish Network’s Sling TV and Sony’s PlayStation Vue they claim, though not with the kind of data that would make the case conclusively. But 2017 might make the argument obsolete. People who subscribe to the pricey expanded basic bundle could have second thoughts when they see the burgeoning range of OTT options and low prices. AT&T startled the industry last month when it introduced its DirecTV Now with more than 100 channels at $35 a month — a price that seemed too low to even make a profit. Hulu is expected to have a competitive offering when it introduces its plan, possibly as early as next month. Google is cooking up a so-called skinny bundle service that would include all of the major broadcast networks. Other powers including Apple and Amazon probably won’t allow so many rivals have the field to themselves. And incumbents including Comcast and Charter might offer their own inexpensive, broadband-delivered video services in the markets they serve. (Cable companies entering the OTT market will have to do a much better job appealing to viewers than they have with their TV Everywhere streaming services. To take one admittedly isolated example: If you stream CNBC on Charter’s New York City service you’ll quickly become either crazed or numb from the volume spikes for seven ads that run over and over. Two of them each run six times an hour — hour after hour.) Will Disney make a mega-deal? Several indicators point that way, especially if the Trump administration warms to media mergers. CEO Bob Iger is under the gun: His stock has been down-to-flat in 2016 as investors wonder how Disney’s ESPN-led cable networks, which account for more than 42% of the entertainment giant’s operating profits, can grow in a period of pay TV cord cutting and cost shaving. Even though Disney generates some of the country’s most popular movies and TV shows, Iger said in October that “it’s almost not enough to have all that stuff unless you have access to your consumer.” RelatedDisney’s Bob Iger Assures Wall Street He’s “Bullish” About ESPN’s Prospects Many wonder whether Iger might buy something big. Netflix and Twitter were among the names bandied about this year. But it’s just as likely that he’d sell. He could do so: Disney is the only Big Media company not controlled by a single family now that AT&T has a deal to buy Time Warner. Iger also is looking to retire and hasn’t had a clear successor since April when then-COO and heir apparent Tom Staggs said he was stepping down. It would take a large company to afford Disney, which has a market value of nearly $167 billion. That wouldn’t intimidate Apple, which is about four times bigger measured by market value and has more than $67 billion in cash and short-term investments. Iger already sits on Apple’s board. Apple shareholders might balk at the idea of a Disney union: The tech company offers no apparent solution for ESPN. And though most companies would love to earn Disney’s roughly 20% return on invested capital, it would be a drag on Apple, which generates about 37%. Another possibility: Facebook, which is twice Disney’s market size and has $26 billion handy. Its COO, Sheryl Sandberg, sits on Disney’s board and is widely considered a possible successor to Iger. Who else could make a deal? Liberty Media’s John Malone is still busy with the companies he either owns or controls. This year he persuaded Lionsgate (where he’s an influential shareholder and board member) to buy Starz (which he controlled). And Charter Communications (which he controls) became the No. 2 cable company by acquiring Time Warner Cable. RelatedDoes Lionsgate’s Deal With Starz Make Sense? Yes, For John Malone The deals give him options. Lionsgate or Charter could consolidate companies that want additional scale to keep up with AT&T-Time Warner and Comcast-NBCUniversal. Malone owns a big stake in Discovery Communications, keeping it in any conversation about potential transactions. Others that seem ripe for alliances include independent network owners AMC Networks and Scripps Networks. You also have to wonder whether Shari Redstone, now in charge of her family’s media empire, might warm to an offer for ailing Viacom now that she has soured on the idea of merging it with CBS. Telecom also is ready for change — especially as the industry prepares the upgrades needed to challenge cable companies with speedy 5G wireless broadband: T-Mobile and Sprint probably either need to merge or find a partner who can help them keep up with AT&T and Verizon. Dish Network also might be part of the mix — CEO Charlie Ergen said last month that 2017 would be a year when “interesting things happen.” He offers the No. 2 satellite service, its Sling TV streaming service and potentially valuable airwave spectrum. What will the FCC do? Under Trump, tech companies won’t “have a direct pipeline to the White House anymore,” Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei said last month. He added that Alphabet (Google) Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt “may have to move out of the Lincoln bedroom.” The quip captured the conventional wisdom that a Republican-led FCC will drop or reverse several major initiatives Chairman Tom Wheeler drove during the last few years. They include tough enforcement of net neutrality rules, open competition for cable set-top boxes and empowering consumers to control the data about their internet use collected by service providers. Few doubt that’s what the FCC will do if Trump takes the advice of current GOP commissioners or the people who he picked to help oversee the transition there. That helps to explain the double-digit percentage increases since the election in stock prices for Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon — and flattening to low single digits for Netflix. But are those making these bets underestimating the potential impact of a netroots backlash? A record 45,000 people flooded the FCC with comments — overwhelmingly calling for net neutrality reform — after HBO’s John Oliver broadcast a call to action. Several websites engaged in an Internet Slowdown Day, designed to illustrate how they could be affected by service providers that offer some sites speedier transmissions than others. RelatedNet Neutrality 101: What It Is, What The FCC Did And Why It’s Important By early 2015 pollsters found that more than 70% of Democrats and Republicans agreed with the principles of net neutrality — even though most were unfamiliar with the term. How will the relationship between studios and exhibitors change? Something’s got to give. Studio owners including Time Warner and Fox say that they’re determined to offer at least some new films on-demand to home audiences. Theater owners, for the most part, say that they can’t afford to give up their most potent selling point: that they’re the only place people can see hit movies while they’re hot. The camps are negotiating — but with one important change. Dalian Wanda Group-controlled AMC Entertainment has shown that it doesn’t necessarily sing from the exhibition industry’s hymnal. That’s important because its recent deals to buy Carmike Cinemas and UK-based Odeon & UCI Cinemas transformed it from the No. 2 domestic theater owner into the world’s largest. CEO Adam Aron showed his independent mindedness in September when he took a surprising shot at the National Association of Theatre Owners. Its chief John Fithian challenged Fox CEO James Murdoch’s attack on the industry’s “crazy” 90-day exclusivity restrictions. Fithian said that Murdoch should “take some time to learn how [the movie business] works.” RelatedNATO Chief To James Murdoch: “Get The Record Straight” On Theater Exclusivity But Aron released his own statement calling NATO’s response “condescending and gratuitous.” He added that AMC “is willing to work with Fox and our other studio partners to intelligently do what we can to help improve studio profitability and ensure that filmmakers continue to have the freedom to captivate moviegoers, all the while ensuring that the enormous investment by theatre operators can continue to be prudently made and rewarded.” Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 7 7 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Too many choices, very little true quality.... • on Dec 26, 2016 3:53 pm The best thing that we all can do is STOP buying programming. Life was just fine, maybe even better, BEFORE cable, satellite, streaming, etc. it’s called BROADCAST TV. We have an antenna on top of our house and get 120+ HDTV channels. There are digital sub-channels for nearly every digital channel. It’s awesome. I watch commercials, buy products, support businesses, and pay zero. No one “needs” all of the useless crap that’s produced • I’ll just take ‘some’ useless crap. LOL At least my useless crap is free. By the way, I’ve worked in network tv for 35 years. I know crap when I see it. Hahaha Reply anon • on Dec 26, 2016 6:15 pm I wouldn’t be surprised if suddenly Hollywood rediscovered Joe Esterhas’ “Scared Cows” script that was shelved during the Clinton years and decided that now was the time to make it. Reply IRON WILL • on Dec 26, 2016 10:04 pm As they should! Trump has amassed a vast fortune for his talent of leadership, deal-making, and tapping the best people to delegate responsibilities to so that success happens. People hate him – but the bottom-line for many will be brighter with him taking the country back from Obama – believe me! Reply Millenial Griffith • on Dec 27, 2016 8:46 am How’s the winter coming along in Novosibirsk, I.W.? Reply Sterling Z • on Dec 26, 2016 10:20 pm Excellent overview! A couple of things to watch in 2017… more media consolidation to the disadvantage of the U.S. consumer and China’s continual push to control American media assets. Look for Wanda to make a play on Disney. Net. Net. The concept of “too big to fail” is anathema under a Trump regime. Reply TB • on Dec 27, 2016 2:48 am Great article thanks! Will be interesting to see this game played out in 2017. Any talk about reversing the 1948 antitrust ruling that made the studios divest their ownership in movie theaters? Seems like a very antiquated law in this day of vertical integration. Reply Karl was right • on Dec 27, 2016 7:03 am Big media always wanted his election, that’s why they gave him billions of dollars of free advertising. Coming up next: mergers, consolidations, and big bonuses at the top, layoffs at the bottom, and then Disney bitches that people don’t subscribe to ESPN anymore (hint: they can’t afford it).

Secretive technology companies like Apple that wish to keep the very best tech developments under wraps haven’t followed this principle until recently. After an announcement earlier this year that the company would start allowing employees to publish their research, the first academic paper out of Apple was published on December 22. The paper comes from computer vision expert Ashish Shrivastava and a team of engineers working on artificial intelligence at Apple. Specifically, the research looks at algorithms which work to pair labelled computer generated images with unlabelled real images to aid in object recognition. The process is called ‘Simulated and Unsupervised Learning’. It helps with the current problem of unlabelled images which are typically used to train object recognition software. The publication in Cornell University Library is a first for Apple, but it’s almost certainly just the beginning. And with top academic talent seeking to get their work published as an important factor in their careers, this new commitment to research could be a boon to future Apple talent acquisition in the growing field of artificial intelligence.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Mobile Image Source: Veniamin Geskin The iPhone 8 could use dual vertical cameras to put a DSLR-killer in everyone’s pocket Chris Smith @chris_writes December 27th, 2016 at 10:09 AM Share Tweet Most iPhone 8 rumors to date agree that Apple will launch three iPhones next year, including a radically redesigned iPhone 8, and two successors for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. A very puzzling rumor from Asia now claims that Apple is working on a 5-inch iPhone that will feature a vertical dual camera. Is this the iPhone 8? Don't Miss: A man waited 416 days to see what happened when his iPod stopwatch passed 9,999 hours The iPhone 8 is rumored to have a display of around 5 inches, not counting the side curves. The device is also rumored to have a dual-lens rear camera just like the iPhone 7 Plus. Japanese blog Macotakara claims that a 5-inch iPhone is in the works for next year, without specifying any of its specs. This seems to be the iPhone 8, but the report doesn’t mention whether it has an all-glass design (front and rear) and whether it’ll feature a bezel-less display on the front. Instead, Macotakara says the 5-inch iPhone would be similar in specs to the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus that are also in the making. The final specs for all phone will be decided in Apple’s second quarter of the fiscal year 2017. As for that vertical dual camera, we can only speculate at this time. No other iPhone 8 report mentioned the orientation of the dual camera. The simplest explanation might concern internal real estate. One of the reasons there isn’t a dual camera on the iPhone 7 is that it might not fit inside it. A 5-inch iPhone would be wider than the iPhone 7, but not as wide as the iPhone 7 Plus. It would also be taller than the iPhone 7. This might let Apple use a vertical dual camera setup on a 5-inch iPhone, whether it’ll be called the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7s. The dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus uses its two lenses not just for added zoom, but also to enable a “Portrait mode” that emulates the shallow depth-of-field found in far more expensive (and bigger!) SLR and mirrorless cameras. Putting that kind of capability in every single new iPhone would be a serious move by Apple to make the iPhone’s camera better than ever.

Its two new flagship products – the iPhone 7 and the new MacBook Pro – got most attention not for what they included, but rather what they left out. Most of the press coverage of the iPhone 7 focused on the company’s decision to omit the 3.5mm headphone socket. This was despite the fact that the move had been so long rumored that I suspect Apple deliberately leaked its plans in order to give everyone time to get used to the idea. With the year’s MacBook Pro, the headline new feature of the Touch Bar was largely over-shadowed by the company’s decision to go all-in on the relatively new USB-C standard, omitting all other ports bar (ironically) the headphone socket … There were many pointed comments that Apple’s idea of innovation this year appeared to be simply taking things away from users – things that many relied upon. But, I would argue, it is a form of innovation to declare that technology is moving on from older standards. As I wrote before, personally I’m very glad that Apple chose to omit USB-A ports in favor of a set of four USB-C ones. You can buy replacement cables for Lightning, microUSB and miniUSB, so in most cases no dongles are needed. If you do need them for devices with non-removable cables, they are cheap enough that you can buy one per device and leave them permanently connected. What we get in return is a laptop that will remain current for very much longer, and which drops what was always a horrible standard (a cable that could only be inserted one way up but whose up/down orientation was never particularly obvious, and which never fully lived up to the ‘universal’ part of its claim) for a small, neat, reversible one capable of very much more. And it seems that giving people time to get used to the idea helps. When we first ran a poll in early November, views were very split. While going all-in on USB-C was considered more positive than negative, it was a very close-run thing. But a fresh poll last week found the majority describing the transition as no big deal. Similarly with the decision to remove the headphone socket from the iPhone 7, most owners seemed to pretty quickly get used to the idea. It’s worth remembering that the vast majority of iPhone owners never use anything other than the EarPods that come with the phone – and they simply use the supplied Lightning ones now. The minority that want something better have no shortage of options when it comes to wireless headphones, with a few other Lightning models available also. But what of more positive forms of innovation? We should insert here the usual observation: that much as some may look back on the Steve Jobs days with rose-tinted glasses, Apple has never been a company that has introduced new product categories on an annual basis. Nor did it invent any of the product categories it successfully revolutionised. The iPod was launched in 2001. It wasn’t the first portable mp3 player, but it was definitely the best. The iPhone wasn’t launched until six years later, in 2007. Again, it wasn’t the first smartphone, but it was the first to be pitched specifically at a mass-market audience, rather than the techies who used the stylus-driven ones. We then had to wait a further four years, until 2010, for the next product category: the iPad. That, too, wasn’t the first tablet, but it turned something clunky and heavy into something friendly and lightweight. So it isn’t reasonable to complain that Apple isn’t inventing things, nor that it hasn’t revolutionised anything this year. It would, though, be reasonable to observe that the iPhone 7 was more like an iPhone 6ss. Certainly design-wise, the new phone looked very much like the old phone – and that disappointed many, who had grown used to seeing a new look every other year. But if it’s a new look you were after, Apple did at least offer the option of two new colors – even if both of them were black. And there were some worthwhile under-the-hood improvements. IP67 waterproofing may not have been a particularly sexy new feature, but it is one likely to save quite a few iPhones from a premature death. The brighter display with a P3 color gamut was also a reasonably big deal. The iPhone is the world’s most popular camera, and the one in the iPhone 7 got some decent upgrades. A new sensor, a wider aperture (for better low-light performance), optical image stabilization in the smaller model as well as larger, wider color capture, quad-LED flash and body- as well as -face-detection for easier focusing. We also shouldn’t forget the iPhone SE. Granted this is also an old design, it’s both a size and a look that many of us very much prefer – and benefits from the features and performance of a much newer phone. So while it may seem odd to give Apple credit for innovation by effectively updating an older device, it was, at the very least, a smart move. So Apple’s scorecard here would probably be a ‘could try harder’ rather than a ‘not even trying.’ My first impressions of the 2016 MacBook Pro were to be somewhat disappointed. I liked the USB-C ports, Touch ID, super-fast SSD and the more portable form-factor. I was so-so about the Touch Bar. But much as I didn’t expect to love it, it turned out that I do. It’s beautiful. Even the 15-inch model is extremely portable (so much so that my Air has been relegated to backup duties). Touch ID is great. The Touch Bar is more useful than it initially seemed, and will grow more useful. The screen quality is just jaw-droppingly good, both in color reproduction and brightness. I wasn’t massively impressed by the original Retina screens, but this one is utterly fantastic. ‘Better display’ may not sound like a headline feature, but in real-life use it makes more difference than a dozen gimmicks. The keyboard, too, has completely converted me. I hated the first-generation butterfly keyboard on the 12-inch MacBook, but the new MacBook Pro keyboard is my new favorite keyboard, combining the sleekness of a short-travel one with the positive feel and clickiness of a mechanical keyboard. Supplemented by the huge trackpad, with almost one-to-one screen mapping, it’s just a joy to use. So I’d again argue that this comes down to definitions of innovation. Most of the MacBook Pro changes aren’t exciting – they were either overdue, like Touch ID, or obvious next steps, like the sleeker form-factor. But they are definitely worthwhile, and in a mature market like laptops, it’s probably not reasonable to expect more. The one area where Apple does appear to have dropped the ball is battery-life. While some of us are seeing 7-8 hours, which is not unreasonable in an area where all manufacturers present misleading numbers, many are seeing less than half Apple’s claimed 10 hours. We need to see whether this was a bad decision by Apple or something it will be able to fix in software. If Apple can resolve the battery-life issue, I’d give the company a solid ‘great work, keep it coming’; if it can’t, then I’d have to downgrade to a ‘mixed performance – some impressive work, but needs to knuckle down more on the engineering side.’ On the iPad front, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro was again an evolutionary one. In many respects, it wasn’t a huge improvement on the iPad Air 2, and we’d again struggle to find headline-worthy features. But, as with the MacBook Pro, there were small-sounding enhancements that actually make a big difference in use. For outdoor use in particular, the increased brightness and greatly-reduced reflectivity of the screen has been something I’ve really appreciated. Indoors, the wider color gamut makes a huge difference, really bringing photos to life, and the True Tone matching of color temperature is one of those ‘Steve Jobs’ features: nobody would ever ask for it in a focus group, but once you have it, you wouldn’t want to be without it. The much louder speakers really make a difference when using the iPad as a Netflix device – probably one of its most common uses at home. And while I may have been guilty of poking fun at those who use iPads as cameras, it is a remarkably capable one thanks to that 12MP still camera and 4K camcorder. And while I may personally have no use for the Apple Pencil, there’s no doubt that support for this would be enough in itself to justify the upgrade from the Air 2 for many. I’d give the company a ‘solid performance, but keep working hard’ here. Then there was the Apple Watch Series 2. Again, no dramatic headline news here – no on-board cellular functionality or slimmer design – but I’d argue that the new features introduced do dramatically improve the usability of the Watch. Waterproofing is a big one for anyone who loves to swim or even just run or cycle in the rain. It turns it from something you may think twice about wearing to a device you can wear in all weathers and all forms of exercise without worrying. Similarly, having built-in GPS makes the Watch much more useful as a fitness device without having to carry your iPhone with you. And the improved brightness is another small change that makes a big difference in real-life use. ‘Decent if unspectacular results – hoping to see more dramatic improvement next year.’ Apple just managed to sneak under the 2016 wire with its own wireless headphones, AirPods. Once again, Apple has far from first at launching fully-wireless in-ear headphones, but again seems to have made a better job of it than the competition. They may not offer the greatest sound-quality in the world, but the general view seems to be that Apple has produced the most practical fully-wireless earphones – albeit with room for improvement. ‘Solid work, just need to pay more attention to time-keeping.’ Finally, I’d give the company a ‘must try harder’ on the iCloud side of things. There are too many outages, many of them only admitted to long after the fact, and too much flakiness. The Apple ecosystem is one of the company’s greatest strengths, but iCloud is the glue that binds it all together, and that glue definitely needs some work. In terms of goals for 2017, I’d hope that the promise of a spectacular iPhone 8 is realized, and also urge the company to get hard to work on a Mac Pro update worthy of the name. So that’s my report card for Apple in 2016. What did you think of its performance? What do you see as its highs and lows? As ever, please let us know in the comments.

That means you’ll simply screw in the lightbulb and connect it via Bluetooth to enable control using Apple’s Home app and Siri voice commands. LEDVANCE continues to advance light by announcing the HomeKit-enabled SYLVANIA Smart Multicolor A19 bulb that can be easily controlled via Siri and Apple’s Home app without a separate hub. Installation is easy. All you need to do is screw in the Bluetooth-enabled bulb in your favorite lamp, sync it with the Home app, and start controlling your lights. For remote access, the Sylvania Smart Multicolor A19 bulb will require an Apple TV or iPad running iOS 10, which is always a requirement to control any accessory remotely using the HomeKit platform. However, up until now most HomeKit-enabled light bulb products have required a dedicated Wi-Fi hub or bridge product in addition to an Apple TV or iPad for remote access or even basic control. The new Sylvania Smart Multicolor A19 bulb will be available early next year, but the company didn’t offer any details on pricing. The brand currently has other connected LED bulbs (pictured above) that work with a Wi-Fi hub and sell from around $29.99. We expect to see other HomeKit accessory announcements in the coming weeks to line up with CES early next month. Recently we told you about the first HomeKit flood sensor being launched by Fibaro following iOS 10.2’s alert support, while a new developer solution aims to help companies bring HomeKit accessories to market faster.

The next Apple Watch Activity Challenge has slightly different rules than the first… For Apple’s Thanksgiving Day Activity Challenge in the United States, Apple Watch users needed to complete a 5K walk or run using the Workout app or a compatible third-party fitness tracking app to unlock a special iMessage sticker and an Activity achievement. Apple’s second Activity Challenge is all about creating a healthy habits streak. It might take a little more work to achieve, but it will last all through January in case you miss the first opportunity: Earn this special achievement when you close all three Activity rings each day for any full week, Monday to Sunday, in January. You’ll also earn special stickers in the Messages app. The mention of “stickers” versus “sticker” also means completing this challenge will unlock multiple stickers whereas the 5K challenge only unlocked a single sticker in the Activity Messages app. Completing all three Activity rings means standing and moving around for at least 1 minute of 12 different hours each day, completing 30 minutes of exercise throughout the day, and meeting your personal move goal for burning active calories. The last Activity Challenge did have a few issues with correctly giving Apple Watch users credit for achieving the goal, however, so hopefully the bugs have been sorted for this next one. The alert should come in after midnight on Wednesday morning depending on your location.

Today we cover the most popular apps of 2016 according to Apple http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/snapchat-ad-program/ If your Christmas present was an iPhone or an iPad then you have already started to download a ton of apps and games. But, if you don’t know where to start then you must check the list of the most downloaded apps of 2016 by Apple. Apple revealed that Snapchat is the most popular app for 2016. And it looks like Snapchat is having its best year. According to the list the app was more popular than Facebook (yes, that Facebook), Instagram and Pokemon Go. But, we don’t need a list to tell us that. Of course the rest apps of the list are not very unfamiliar with the smartphones users. So, at the top five spots we see Messenger, Pokemon Go, Instagram and Facebook. Also Google Maps and YouTube are amongst the most popular. The strange thing is that many popular free apps didn’t make the top 10 list. For example last year’s winner Trivia Crack was not even on the list. Here’s the full list, according to Apple: Snapchat Messenger Pokémon GO Instagram Facebook YouTube Google Maps Pandora Netflix Spotify Music Also, App Store editors revealed their App of the Year picks for 2016. They chose Prisma for iPhone, Sketchbook Motion for iPad, Twitter for Apple TV, MySwimPro – Personal Swim Trainer for Apple Watch and Bear for Mac. Game of the Year selections include Clash Royale for iPhone, Severed for iPad, Riptide GP: Renegade for Apple TV, Field Day for Apple Watch and Life Is Strange for Mac. And if you you want to spend some money the top paid iPhone apps cover a range of categories, with FaceTune, Heads Up!, 7 Minute Workout Challenge, KIMOJI, Geometry Dash and Face Swap Live among the top 10. Minecraft: Pocket Edition is the most downloaded paid iPad app. Share the joy                 Share this: Reddit Email Facebook Skype Twitter Tumblr Google LinkedIn More Pinterest Author: Martha Papadimitriou Martha is a journalist, a blog writer, a mother and a bookworm.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/File | Caption J Walker Glascock December 27, 2016 —Apple, a company known for their secrecy, announced at a conference earlier this month that their artificial intelligence (AI) team would begin publishing research papers.  The announcement, made during a presentation via a single slide at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference, meant that the tech giant would begin engaging with the rest of the AI research community; a community that has long been combining efforts to further develop AI technology.  In fact, for some time Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and IBM – companies that could benefit greatly from artificial intelligence – have all been openly sharing their research in an effort to jointly progress in this nascent industry. And now, less than a month after announcing their new policy, Apple has already published their first research paper, titled "Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training”. The paper addresses intelligent image-recognition technology, which involves training machines to recognize objects using computer-generated images. The idea behind the paper is that using images that were computer-generated, and thus already labeled and annotated, more quickly and efficiently improves the ability of an algorithm in a machine to recognize characteristics of an image, as opposed to using real-life images, which involves considerably more time and effort. In Pictures What will Apple think of next? Five ridiculous predictions. There exist, however, problems with solely using generated images, namely that they are less photorealistic than real images, and so the machine identifies and learns about only about details that are present in the digital rendering. Thus the paper outlines a hybrid approach of utilizing generated, annotated images and merging them with those from real life, creating sets of photorealistic images that have also been annotated. Though Apple’s recently published paper demonstrates an interesting and unique new approach to an angle of AI technology, their previous reticence in sharing any developments within the company had begun putting-off top-level researchers, possibly holding the company back. Prior to Apple announcing their intention to begin publishing research papers, Google had already open-sourced their Machine Learning Framework called TensorFlow as well as their AI acquisition, DeepMind Labs. Microsoft had open sourced their Cognitive Toolkit and had collaborated with Elon Musk’s Open AI to further advance research and development of new AI products, Wired reported. However Apple has been in the process of accelerating their own machine learning programs, having recently hired prominent Carnegie Mellon researcher, Russ Salakhutdinov (the man who made the announcement at the NIPS conference), as well as acquiring Percepto and Tuplejump, two startups with footholds in the industry. Ideally for the AI industry as a whole, this recent paper will be the first of many to be published from the Apple research team, further participating in the AI community.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Dec 27, 2016 at 9:17AM Image source: Fitbit. A lot of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) smartphone owners were on the receiving end of Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) activity trackers over Christmas. Fitbit is trailing only Super Mario Run on top of Apple's App Store chart among free downloads for the iPhone as of Sunday night, a strong indicator that Fitbit was packed into a lot of stockings over the weekend. It's obviously an encouraging sign for Fitbit shareholders. They've seen their stock plummet 75% this year. Fitbit stock hit a new all-time low on Friday. Slowing sales and concerns that Fitbit devices are collecting dust on retailer shelves have scared investors away, but heavy download activity among iPhone owners suggest that this is not the case. Fitbit wasn't a winner across all app marketplaces. It was No. 44 on Google Play among free downloads, according to applications tracker App Annie. It isn't charting at all for the iPad. The disparity shouldn't come as a surprise. iPhone owners tend to be more affluent than Android users, affording them the ability to splurge on fitness trackers. The iPad isn't as portable as the iPhone, making it a better medium for games and video streaming. Friends before enemies Apple isn't usually played up as a Fitbit ally. Last year's arrival of the Apple Watch and this year's Series 2 update that incorporates built-in GPS could be drying up demand for Fitbit's dedicated activity monitors.  We also recently saw Apple try to make a play for the corporate wellness market that Fitbit seems to have cornered. Apple is hoping that companies will consider subsidizing Apple Watch purchases for their employees, a niche where Fitbit is winning over corporations looking to save money on healthcare costs.  A popular narrative is that Apple products make Fitbit products obsolete, but now we're seeing that iPhone owners are still flocking to Fitbit bracelets even as many slap Apple Watch devices around their wrists.  Instead of enemies or possibly even frenemies, each company could be rooting for the other to succeed. Fitbit's popularity with iPhone owners relative to Android jockeys has to find Fitbit hoping that iOS gains market share. Apple may obviously be hoping for its Apple Watch to become the activity tracker of choice, but Fitbit's appeal to iPhone owners can't be ignored. Fitbit may make more sense as an acquisition target than a competitor to target, especially with the beating that Fitbit stock has experienced over the past year.  There will be challenges for Fitbit. Margins have been contracting, and sales growth has been decelerating. However, after being written off for the holiday quarter, it seems as if Fitbit is showing signs of life -- at least in the realm of iPhones.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple and Fitbit.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 27, 2016 at 10:00AM According to personal computers next year. On deck are next-generation central processing units, faster graphics processors, and the addition of USB-C ports, Gurman says. Apple's iMac lineup. Image source: Apple.  In other words, a sensible set of upgrades and improvements, but nothing groundbreaking. Although not much is known about the iMac computers that will follow the ones that Apple has planned for next year, there is one upgrade that could prove to be quite compelling in the 2018 iMac models -- at least to power users. More processor cores Since 2009, Apple's premium iMac computers have featured processors with up to four processing cores supplied by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The processors Apple uses in the 2017 iMac models are likely to be Intel's seventh-generation Core processors. These chips will, just as their predecessors, also top out at four processor cores. Of course, over the years, those processor cores have become more powerful, so performance has marched upward. However, in 2018, the desktop processor lineup that will be suitable for Apple's iMac systems, which goes by the name Coffee Lake, will feature up to six processor cores -- a 50% jump in core count from current offerings. What this will mean to Mac buyers An increase in core count should enable better performance in processor-intensive applications such as audio and video editing, and it should make multi-tasking smoother, especially with multiple processor intensive programs running in parallel. The average consumer might not view more processor cores as a potential selling point, as the average consumer probably just buys a new system when his or her current system breaks or becomes too slow. However, what I think this might do is shift some prosumers or professional users away from entry-level configurations of Apple's Mac Pro, which can be configured with processors with six or more processor cores, and toward higher-end iMac models. An iMac with a six core processors isn't going to be a suitable replacement for the Mac Pro in all use cases -- there's still a lot of stuff that Apple adds to the Mac Pro that would be tough to get into an all-in-one form factor, such as dual graphics cards. However, I suspect that for a non-trivial subset of potential Mac Pro buyers -- admittedly a small group to begin with -- the case for the Mac Pro will become tougher to make when 2018 rolls around, especially if Apple doesn't bother to update the Mac Pro soon.  Apple will need to update the Mac Pro to keep it relevant Apple hasn't updated the Mac Pro in years. The current Mac Pro systems use Intel's Ivy Bridge-EP processors, which first made their debut in the latter half of 2013. Since then, the chipmaker has released not one but two successors to the Ivy Bridge-EP chips, Haswell-EP and then Broadwell-EP. The Apple Mac Pro. Image source: Apple.  And, in mid-2017, Intel is expected to release the successor to Broadwell-EP, known as Skylake-EP. It's not clear why Apple hasn't bothered to update this system. Perhaps Apple doesn't sell enough of them to justify the R&D investment to refresh the lineup rapidly. But if the company wants to keep this product line relevant, updating it sooner rather than later and then committing to keeping the systems fresh as new components arrive would be a good idea.

Credit: Getty Images Until this year, it was hard to imagine 12 months going by without Apple producing something worth lusting after. This was a long, and relatively unbroken, tradition dating back to the first iPod in 2001 and continuing straight through the debuts of the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010. Apple also jumpstarted categories where innovation had stalled, changing the direction of laptop design with its ultralight, razor-thin Macbook Air. Whether you had the means to pick up one of these treasures, or just stared at them through Apple Store windows, Cupertino seemed to have struck a Faustian deal to consistently pump out gadgets that we coveted by everyone, except maybe the most embittered PC partisans. ALSO: How to Survive Social Media in 2017 (Without Quitting Completely) This year, Apple's winning streak ended. The company offered relatively minor updates of existing product lines, including a new generation of iPhone 7 that sacrificed a pre-existing feature — the phone lost its standard headphone jack — but offered no real benefit in return. The Apple Watch Series 2 has some impressive fitness-based upgrades, and yet sales of the smartwatch have plummeted compared to 2015, while fitness tracker sales continue to climb, suggesting that many customers are rejecting the idea of a pricey wrist computer in favor of simpler, cheaper wearables. The latest 10-inch iPad is an all-around fancier device, but lacks any jaw-dropping innovation. And the new Macbook Pro offers little to justify its stunning pricetag aside from The Touch Strip, a multi-touch glass that runs across the top of the keyboard. But if Apple had a ho-hum 2016, here's the worse news for consumer tech: so did just about everyone else. It's not that 2016 was a bad year for Apple. The MacBook Pro is selling well, and iPhone 7's are still iPhones, meaning they're on track to become the single most popular model of smartphone on the planet. But it was an underwhelming year for Apple in that none of its products were a big deal. If those new releases entered the national conversation at all, it was on the surly end of the spectrum, with the death of headphone jacks and USB ports reigniting old, often unfair criticisms that Apple regularly bullies its own customers into buying new hardware. But if Apple had a ho-hum 2016, here's the worse news for consumer tech: so did just about everyone else. Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 phone wasn't exactly lighting up the blogosphere, at least until an alarming number of units started bursting into flames. Microsoft released a blitz of commercials touting the new generation of its Surface Pro 4, but none of its features are notably better or different than the models that came before. Oculus won't say how many of its Rift virtual reality headsets have sold, capping off years of hype with yet another sad-trombone note for the VR revolution that stubbornly refuses to show up. Though 4K-resolution TVs came down in price, 4K content is still insanely hard to find. Even video game console-makers punted the ball, promising new generations in 2017, while offering moderately upgraded versions to anyone unwise enough to join the last gasps of this waning console war. To poorly paraphrase R.E.M., when it came to this past year's hardware, nothing was up the industry's sleeve, and nothing was cool. Maybe 2017 will prove us wrong, and a slew of iconic gadgets will make everyone shut up about the latest Twitter war or Snapchat filter or robotic car, and make consumer electronics as relevant as ever.  It's possible that this wasn't just a down year for exciting gear, but the beginning of the end of noteworthy hardware. After all, Apple's winning streak started with the revelation that the coolest hardware was just a conduit for even cooler code. That was the iPod, a device that deserves its place in the Museum of Modern Art's celebration of industrial design, but whose popularity had more to do with mainstreaming digital music, and introducing the world to the idea that you could safely, and legally download entertainment over the internet. The iPhone upended mobile phones by surrendering the handset's hardware to software, replacing buttons with graphics and making data plans more relevant than calling plans. Whether Apple started this trend or got in early enough to seem like they did, Cupertino played a role in the gradual, and inevitable decline of hardware innovation.  The supremacy of data over hardware seems to be hitting other industries, too. Five years ago journalists were comparing the dueling design strategies of the Chevrolet Volt's mix of electric drive for short trips and fuel-burn for longer rides with Nissan and Tesla's battery-only cars. Today, it's the breakthroughs in code, not drivetrain, that have the world's attention, as the promise of autonomous vehicles appears increasingly viable. The only new aircraft that are interesting are drones, because of the software that runs them, rather than the rotors that keep them in the air. It's no real surprise software innovation is outpacing hardware. Physical technology is shackled by the harsher laws of physics, while code swans through the world, constrained only by imagination (and the number of electrons that are available, and how fast they can race between locations). Maybe 2017 will prove us wrong, and a slew of iconic gadgets will make everyone shut up about the latest Twitter war or Snapchat filter or robotic car, and make consumer electronics as relevant as ever. But all hope for hardware isn't lost just yet. There was one new class of product in 2016 that felt fresh and innovative, because of the way it harnessed data. They're called smart speakers, and they're a blast. Though Amazon created the category of voice-controlled, internet-connected speakers in 2015 with the Echo, it wasn't until last year that it secured enough partners and algorithm smarts to pull off its coolest tricks. If Echo can hear your voice, it can call you an Uber, or turn down the Wifi-connected lights or thermostat, play music from your Spotify account, or draw from the internet to answer questions. Unfortunately, Echo is a bit of a dunce in that last regard, punting on a surprising number of requests. That's why the newer Google Home feels more like the fully-realized example of this category. It supplies answers more often and delivers on the long-delayed promise of voice computing, by letting anyone within yelling distance of the device use it to set timers, dim smart lights, or try to stump its fancy algorithms.

Prior to the Thursday publish date, the legendarily secretive Apple has kept all of its research locked up, particularly where AI is involved. AI is the motor that makes Siri, Apple's voice assistant, run -- among many other future and present uses. Sharing findings with academics can help advance the field for everyone, not only Apple. AI is immensely important for Apple, which competes directly with Google, Amazon and Microsoft in bringing meaningful artificial intelligence to tech. By making its projects transparent, Apple can also hope to recruit top researchers. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

To earn the achievement, Apple Watch owners will have to close all three Activity rings each day for an entire week in January. Image via MacRumors forum member friednoodles The challenge should become visible for all Apple Watch wearers within the Activity app at midnight local time on December 28. Similar to the Thanksgiving Achievement, if users complete the new challenge they'll gain access to "special stickers" in iMessages.

Ars Staff - Dec 27, 2016 3:15 pm UTC Enlarge / Here, the Three Wise Men prepare to engage in feats of strength. reader comments 226 Share this story Christmas Day has come and gone. The cards and presents have been opened, the dinners have been eaten, the trash has been hauled, and now we settle into that weird post-Christmas week where some folks are back at work and others are still lazing around on vacation until after New Year's. Which am I? Clearly, I'm here working—somebody's got to keep the lights on, after all. Aside from Christmas, though, one other major holiday that has come and gone is Festivus, the secular parody holiday from the TV show Seinfeld. Traditionally celebrated on December 23, Festivus calls for (among other things) an airing of grievances—on the show, this usually just involves George's father yelling at everyone, but here at Ars we also have some stuff we want to get off our collective chest. Keeping our nose to the tech news all year long means we see and deal with a lot of trends in technology that annoy us—from stupid printers to dumb Android OEMs to just about anything else. Even though Festivus is passed, we asked the Ars staff to write down their grievances for airing anyway—because who doesn't love reading about someone else's angst? Presented below, in alphabetical order, is the Ars Technica staff's 2016 airing of techno-grievances. Ron Amadeo: Groupthink makes Android OEMs collectively dumb My problem this Festivus is, as usual, with Android OEMs. With something like 1,300 companies selling Android devices, you'd think there would be a lot of truly different choices out there. You'd also think that, since they are pretty much all stuck shipping identical SoCs and displays, they'd be leaping at any differentiation they can create when it comes to the design and software. Unfortunately, the Android OEMs—especially the big ones—all seem to easily fall victim to groupthink. A great example came this year when Apple dumped the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. The move was widely panned as anti-consumer, and Apple's justification for removing the jack, "courage," became an instant parody. The Android OEMs saw the outrage online and said "What a great idea!" Rather than using the presence of a headphone jack as a key marketing point, OEMs began stripping it from their product roadmaps to ape Apple. Enlarge / They're everywhere—and they all look the same. Aurich Lawson Chinese OEM LeEco was one of the first to jump off the bridge because Apple was doing it, too, with the company releasing a line of phones sans-headphone jack. Motorola followed suit with the modular Moto Z; then we saw HTC do it with the HTC Bolt. Now the rumor mill is claiming Samsung will dump the headphone jack with the Galaxy S8. If any one of these companies talked to consumers or read an online forum, they'd realize this is a bad idea. This thinking permeates the Android landscape. Everyone's "flagship" smartphone is the same ultra fast, ultra thin slab phone that has just enough battery life to maybe last a day of light usage. No one even attempts to make a high-end phone that values battery life over thinness and speed to any meaningful degree. Not everyone wants a "game console" smartphone that doubles as a VR headset, but that doesn't mean they want a bargain-bin midrange phone. Companies make high-end gaming laptops and high-end business laptops, so how about if high-end business smartphones with an extra long battery life become a regular thing? You'll never see it because of Android OEM groupthink. Enlarge / Nexus, Pixel—potato, potato. And remember when phones came in different form factors? Would it kill anyone to offer a premium phone with a hardware keyboard anymore? Does every device have to be a symmetrical slab-style iPhone clone? One of the only companies to recently deviate from the "standard smartphone" formula was BlackBerry, which—as an outsider to the world of Android—released the Priv, a phone with a slide-out keyboard. Of course the device was also poorly made and overpriced, so when no one bought it, Blackberry quit the market after one try. The only company out there we feel is doing anything new lately is Xiaomi with the Mi Mix, which changed up the usual smartphone template with a more screen-centric design. There isn't much difference in the software, either. Everyone takes Android and piles as much crap on top of it as possible, with no one attempting to promote a "clean, fast, optimized" software build. Is there really a meaningful difference between Samsung's TouchWiz, Huawei's Emotion UI, LG's LG UX, or Xiaomi's MIUI? You aren't differentiating with a heavy Android skin when everyone makes a heavy Android skin. Even Google fell victim to the Android OEM groupthink. It risked a lot and potentially damaged its relationships with OEMs when it made a move into self-branded smartphone hardware and then didn't do anything special with that hardware. Why make hardware if you're just going to make the same hardware everyone else is making? I've tried pretty much every high-end smartphone over the last few years, and while there are one or two exceptions to some of the groupthink, it's really a shame that I spend all my time writing about the 10 percent difference between smartphones. There is so much more space to explore when it comes to designing a smartphone, but most OEMs are only open to taking the established, safe option. Jon Brodkin: Sign in with your TV provider... again and again As an obsessive sports fan who follows many teams and leagues in both the US and Europe, I'm not giving up regular TV any time soon. But I do like streaming apps, and I often use the ones that give me full access to content when I sign in with my Verizon FiOS TV credentials. That's fine, of course—but what I hate is that nearly all of these apps force me to enter my username and password almost every time I open them. Enlarge / This is the reason why Jon Brodkin has to sign in over and over again. Whenever I try to watch a game on the NBC Sports, Fox Sports Go, or NFL apps on my iPhone or iPad, it's almost a certainty that my Verizon username and password will have been forgotten by the app and I'll have to enter them again. As I write this, I just checked all three apps and all three want my Verizon username and password again, even though I have signed into each one many times before. 1Password helps here, but these apps don't integrate with it so I have to switch back and forth between my password manager and each video app a couple of times to get logged in. And the next time I want to use the app, probably a couple weeks from now, I'll almost certainly have to do it again. I understand that the apps need to verify that I'm still subscribed to Verizon, but this seems like a problem that should be easily solved by each app remembering the password on the device. In my latest testing, it seems the ESPN app is able to do this, but NBC, FOX, and the NFL weren't able to. On the Apple TV, apps do a better job keeping me signed in for many weeks at a time. Why can't the phone work like this? Recent OS updates for iPhones, iPads, and the Apple TV introduced single sign-on so you can log into all apps requiring TV provider credentials only once. Naturally, Verizon FiOS doesn't support the single sign-on yet, and most of the video apps I use don’t support it either. But there’s some progress: Single sign-on is supported by CenturyLink, DirecTV, Dish, Sling TV, and a few other lesser-known TV providers. If the major cable TV companies and programmers get on board, there’ll finally be significant progress on an annoyance that’s been allowed to fester for several years. Andrew Cunningham: What's the deal with printers? You can draw a direct line between a desktop or laptop in 1996 and a desktop or laptop in 2016, but the technology has improved immeasurably in the last 20 years. Computers are thinner and lighter and more power efficient, and generally speaking they’re both more powerful and easier to use. Printers are a little different. That’s not just because a printer in 1996 doesn’t look all that different from a printer in 2016—the advent of small consumer all-in-ones and wireless printing aside—but also because a printer in 2016 can be expected to be just as inconsistent and infuriating as your old HP LaserJet 4P. Enlarge / Why does it say paper jam when there is no paper jam? HP Laserjet Wiki The setup process has generally been simplified—both Windows 10 and macOS will download and install the proper printer driver for you without user intervention at this point. But lord help you if something goes wrong—deleting and re-adding printers and visiting the Windows 95-looking print queue window are still your primary troubleshooting tools. Ink estimates from drivers are still inaccurate, and paying for ink still feels like participating in a grand scam. If anything, the modern era has made ink more irritating than before. The consumer-friendly wonder that is DRM came for our movies and music first, but now it has also come for our coffee pods and third-party ink cartridges. Wonderful. If friends and family members have tech questions for me, I’m usually glad to take a crack at them. But if it’s a printer problem, I’m more inclined to find the nearest hole in the ground and jump head-first into it.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Consumer Reports: Don't buy the new MacBook Pro by David Goldman   @DavidGoldmanCNN December 23, 2016: 11:31 AM ET Hands on with the MacBook Pro If you've been drooling over Apple's flashy new MacBook Pro, you might want to stuff your stocking with a different laptop. Consumer Reports said Thursday that it has decided not to recommend Apple's new MacBook Pros, because the notebooks' battery life can be miserable. The issue isn't exactly new: Many MacBook Pro owners have been complaining on social media that their computers have short battery life. Consumer Reports' tests confirmed customers' gripes. The MacBook Pro's battery life was "highly inconsistent from one trial to the next," Consumer Reports said in its review. For example one MacBook Pro model ran 16 hours in one test and less than four hours in the next. Another got a stunning 19.5 hours of battery life in its best test, and dropped to a woeful 4.5 hours in its worst. Although battery life can vary from test to test, Consumer Reports said a fluctuation as large as the one it experienced on the MacBook Pro is extremely rare. Usually, laptop battery life only varies about 5% from test to test. Since Consumer Reports said averaging the battery life length would not reflect what a customer would actually experience, it decided to factor in the lowest battery life measured for each model. That resulted in some truly dreadful ratings. The 15-inch version received a score of 56 out of 100. The 13-inch version without the new Touch Bar got a 47, and the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar only got a score of 40. That's well south of the MacBook Air (70 of 100), which is half the price of the cheapest MacBook Pro that Consumer Reports reviewed. The $585 Acer Aspire even scored higher than the new MacBooks. Consumer Reports' best-reviewed model is the Vaio Z, which received an overall score of 81 out of 100. None of the MacBook Pro's scores were high enough for Consumer Reports to recommend them. It marked the first time Consumer Reports said consumers shouldn't buy a MacBook. An Apple (AAPL, Tech30) spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Related: Is the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar a gimmick? Apple claims that the new MacBook Pros get 10 hours of battery life. The new computers' most notable new feature is the Touch Bar, a touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard that changes functions based on the software running on screen. Consumer Reports and Apple have a checkered history. The magazine notoriously failed to recommend the iPhone 4 for its 'antennagate' signal issues, even though it rated the phone higher than any other smartphone on the market. That led to a crabby Steve Jobs giving a press conference, announcing that Apple would give every iPhone 4 customer a free case. But Consumer Reports was the first major publication to throw cold water on Apple's 'bendgate' phone cracking controversy. In lab tests, Consumer Reports found that the iPhone 6 was far more durable than YouTube videos made it appear.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Granted 70 Patents Covering Night Shift, 3D Maps, Smart Keyboard Connector, a Security Attachment and More | Main | New Patents Show that Samsung's Engineers are continually trying to reinvent the Smartwatch in Different Ways » December 27, 2016 Beyond the Courts, Nokia's Revenge against Apple begins in 2017 with all-new Smartphones to Hit Apple on Price   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Politics and the Chinese Smartphone Invasion into the U.S could Cause some Havoc for both Samsung and Apple in 2017." The report noted that Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi at minimum were scheduled to land in the U.S. market in early 2017 and that between them and Google's own Pixel smartphone gathering steam in the New Year would eventually hurt Samsung's market share in the U.S. Today we're learning that some of that havoc may be coming Apple's way too with Nokia reentering the smartphone market with high-end specs and lowball pricing that could eventually put pressure on Apple's pricing model.   In yesterday's report I had noted that it would be great if Apple had a new 5" iPhone model priced a little sharper to appeal to emerging markets such as India and especially Indonesia. A new rumor surfacing today from Japan's Mac Okatara reveals that Apple may in fact introduce a new 5" iPhone with a vertical dual lens camera system. While Okatara doesn't always get rumors right, they did get Apple dropping the iPhone's headphone jack and the new glossy black iPhone 7 model right .   Earlier this month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple's is Entering Indonesia in 2017, one of the Top Emerging Markets with a Massive Growing Middle Class." In that report I noted that "At present, the current smartphone players in the top five chart are seemingly focused on the lower to mid-end of the market with prices in the $250-$300 and the $100-$200 tiers, none of which Apple participates in. Smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy J7 ($230), Oppo F1s ($235) and the ASUS Zenphone Selfie ($315 aprox) are the hot sellers. All three of these smartphones offer a 5.5" 1080p display at prices lower than Apple's entry 4" iPhone SE which starts at $400 with half the storage.   While Apple hasn't exhausted tapping into the upper middle class markets around the world just yet, in order to sustain market growth may require Apple to get a little more serious about the top end of the middle-tier of smartphones that are offering tempting specs for those just entering the market. The standard is quickly becoming 5" or 5.5" displays, not 4" as Apple's iPhone SE.   If you've been paying attention to the news lately, then you're likely aware that Apple sued Acacia Research for being in a conspiracy with Nokia against them. Nokia responded within 24 hours hitting Apple with a series of patent infringement lawsuits (one, two and more) around the world.   So on one hand Nokia is out to sue Apple for everything it can and continually bury Apple in patent infringement lawsuits for as far as the eye could see, even suing Apple for using technology found in supplier parts like those from Qualcomm. They want to squeeze every penny that they can out of Apple for getting run over by the iPhone. Nokia sold their phone business to Microsoft who got killed taking on that garbage brand and technology no one apparently wanted with an OS from hell.   On the other side of the equation Nokia is coming back to the phone market under HMD, the new home for Nokia phones.   According to a new report published earlier today, "Finland-based HMD Global is expected to announce its first Nokia-branded smartphones in February 2017 at Mobile World Congress (MWC), and has been cooperating with supply chain makers in Taiwan to develop four more models for launch in the second and third quarters of 2017, according to industry sources.   The four new models will have display sizes ranging from 5.0 to 5.7-inch at WQHD or Full HD resolutions, said the sources, adding that panel suppliers will include LG Display, Century Technology (CTC) and Innolux, and that FIH Mobile will serve as production partner.   The first Nokia smartphone to be presented by HMD at MWC is likely to be the Nokia DIC, which will be available in two versions, depending on the amount of memory and display size, according to a Chinese-language technews.com report.   The higher-priced version of the two variants will cost US$200, and come with 3GB of RAM and a 5.5-inch Full HD (1080p) display. The cheaper version is to cost US$150, packed with 2GB RAM and a 5-inch Full HD display, said the report.   Most of Apple's top competitors and now Nokia are making 5" the smallest display size for consumers and 5.5" models at super economical pricing like $50 more. So the rumor of Apple bringing a new 5" model is interesting – even though, despite all hope, Apple will likely price it out of reach for most consumers in emerging markets.   When the entire smartphone industry is raising the specifications bar while lowering the prices of the mid-tier range, at some point consumers won't be able to be tempted by an iPhone with smaller displays at double, triple and quadruple prices.   At the end of the day, smartphone players around the world are shifting their war plans against Apple and it's beginning to work in China. But we now have to acknowledge that Nokia's game plan is not only to sue Apple on an ongoing basis until they pound them into submission, they're now reentering the smartphone market with high-end specs and dirt low pricing to hurt Apple. No, to kill Apple.   Apple noted in their most recent lawsuit against Acacia Research that "As Nokia's CEO had announced to employees the previous year, Nokia was standing on "a burning platform." Unable to compete with innovative companies such as Apple—which had developed a revolutionary hardware and software platform—Nokia quickly transformed itself. It changed from a company focused on supplying cell phones and other consumer products to a company bent on exploiting the patents that remain from its years as a successful cell phone supplier. In its changed form, Nokia has sought to extract exorbitant patent royalties from Apple and other cell phone makers, and Acacia and Conversant have been its willing conspirators to that end."   Nokia is going to make Apple eat their words that they were unable to compete with innovative companies like Apple. They're going to hammer them on patent fees and lowball the market on price to help turn the tide on Apple where high consumer pricing will no longer be tolerated, forcing Apple to lower prices or continue to slide to the 4 or 5% market share point; a point where developers will begin to think twice about developing for iOS.   Will Nokia's revengeful plan succeed or will Apple continually outsmart them so that the world will watch Nokia fail for a second time in history? The war has begun and it's now going to go far beyond just battling it out in the courts over patent fees. In 2017, Nokia is taking their battle to Apple in the marketplace directly. Their phones will likely debut in emerging markets like China and India first so as to build up mass production before turning their attention to the U.S. This could get nasty very quickly.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

For some, the important part of the news is that Apple published a paper at all, given the company's secretive nature.  ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple has published its first research paper, which focuses on artificial intelligence. Specifically, the paper discusses methods for the improvement of the recognition of computer vision systems. The publication of the paper marks a new direction for Apple, as it has been traditionally secretive with its research. Apple's Artificial Intelligence Research Paper Explained The first research paper of Apple, published on Dec. 22 and titled "Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training," was submitted on Nov. 15. The paper describes a technique that improves the training that can be given to an algorithm for its ability to recognize images through computer-generated pictures as opposed to real-world pictures. In machine learning, using computer-generated images in training neural networks is seen as more efficient, due to the fact that such pictures are already likely labeled with the proper information. Pictures taken of real-world situations likely do not have such information, which would require work to label them one-by-one. However, the downside of using computer-generated images is that sometimes, details in them do not carry over to real-world scenes. Neural networks will then be confused with the difference, making them fail to recognize what should be two similar pictures. The solution to the problem, according to Apple researchers is what is known as Simulated+Unsupervised learning. Through the method, the realism of computer-generated images is boosted to put them in line with real-world images. Apple Now Opening Up? For some players and reporters in the tech industry, the important part of the publication of Apple's first research paper is that it even exists, as Apple has previously locked up all its research, especially in the field of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is at the heart of Siri, which is Apple's digital personal assistant, with the technology expected to find its way into even more Apple services and products in the future. So why would Apple choose to publish a paper on its research for a method that competitors such as Google and Microsoft can use? With the sharing of their findings to the academic community, Apple will help in advancing the field for the entire industry, which would benefit all companies and consumers as development in artificial intelligence will lead to smarter products and services. In addition, if Apple continues to open up and publish its advancements in artificial intelligence research, it might be able to lure top researchers in the field to work with the company for the technology's continued growth. Apple has made strides in artificial intelligence through acquisitions and new hires, and it will continue to do so as it dives even deeper into research on the technology.

(AAPL) MUST Do to Soar in 2017 Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Smashes All the Records With Amazon Echo The Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone WAS the Most Popular Smartphone, But … View All Posts Fitbit Inc (FIT) started 2016 in a slump, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its Apple Watch rapidly gaining market share, while China’s Xiaomi continues to gain ground by selling cheap fitness trackers. Source: Fitbit Fitbit just announced another new wearable product for its lineup, the Fitbit Alta. Unfortunately, like the previously announced Blaze, news of the Fitbit Alta failed to ignite FIT stock. State of the Market for FIT Stock 2015 was a challenging year for Fitbit and 2016 isn’t starting out the way it had hoped. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for 2016 The company remains the leader in the fast-growing wearables market and no one disputes the fact that it makes some of the finest activity trackers around. Well, some Fitbit users aren’t too pleased with the heart rate monitors in its products, but Fitbit gear is generally highly rated by people who want to track their daily fitness and sleep stats. However, when the Apple Watch was released in early 2015, its combination of activity tracking credibility, smart capabilities and style quickly propelled Apple into second place in the wearables market and it came close to catching Fitbit, with 18.6% of the market in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 22.2% for Fitbit. Adding to Fitbit’s worries, Xiaomi posted crazy 815% growth in the same period by selling inexpensive fitness trackers like the 30-day battery life, $15 Mi Band. With 17.4% market share, Xiaomi is also within striking distance of Fitbit. Meanwhile Fitbit went through all of 2015 without releasing a new wearable to take on the Apple Watch or the Mi Band. FIT stock dropped steadily from a high near $52 in August to close out the year in the $30 range. The announcement of the Fitbit Blaze at the 2016 Consumer Electronic Show was supposed to turn things around for Fitbit, with a new smartwatch-inspired wearable with fashionable, interchangeable bands and frames. That didn’t go as planned, with FIT stock dropping over 10% after the announcement. Today, another new wearable was unveiled: the Fitbit Alta. Rather than gunning for smartwatch shoppers like the Blaze does, the $129.95 Alta is a simple, bracelet-style wearable that tracks activity basics, while displaying call and text notifications from a paired smartphone. Where the Fitbit Alta follows in the footsteps of the Blaze, though, is with its clear targeting of the fashion-conscious crowd. The company is offering “Luxe Collection” and “Classic Collection” accessories for the Fitbit Alta, including a $99.95 metal bracelet, along with $79.95 pink and graphite leather bands. Even the tagline for the Fitbit Alta conveys the message that this is a device that’s about fashion as much as it is about fitness tracking: “Motivation is your best accessory with this fitness wristband.” Good News for Fitbit? The market reaction to the Fitbit Alta hasn’t been as bad as the Blaze fiasco, but the sound of crickets — FIT stock was down slightly Wednesday from where it was before the announcement — isn’t much of an improvement. Clearly Fitbit is not going to go after Xiaomi. Selling $15 fitness trackers is not the sort of business it wants to be in. But the Apple is worrisome and despite Fitbit’s attempts to brush off the Apple Watch as not really being a competing device, the fact remains that Apple’s wearable is pulling off the fashion accessory/smartwatch/fitness tracker juggling act fairly well. With the Blaze and now the Alta, it looks as though Fitbit’s strategy for 2016 is to leave its core demographic of serious fitness tracking enthusiasts with the older Surge and Charge HR trackers. New product development (at least to this point) seems focused less on hardcore fitness buffs and more on the people who buy a wearable as a fashion accessory that happens to offer some activity tracking capabilities. In other words, Fitbit is focused on trying to prevent the Apple Watch from taking the wearable crown by trying to play Apple’s game. This is a significant shift for Fitbit and it’s not without risk. Its core demographic is bound to get tired of waiting for new, more capable devices. While the new Fitbit Alta is affordable and stylish, it lacks a heart rate sensor so traditional Fitbit fans might pass it by. When it’s dressed up with the optional metal bracelet, it becomes a $230 device, putting it at nearly the same price as options like Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT) much more capable Band wearable and little more than $100 from an Apple Watch and its full-blown smartwatch cred. If Fitbit got it right and the key to selling more wearables in 2016 is to focus on style as much as substance, then FIT stock may yet recover. If not, the slide — it’s now down over 17% from its June 2015 IPO — is likely to continue. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

But the year wasn't so good for all tech products. Here's a closer look at the tech products that hit the bucket in 2016. Samantha Murphy Kelly CNN Money (CNN) -- Innovation made significant progress in 2016. We saw an Amazon drone make its first commercial delivery in the U.K. and a fleet of self-driving Ubers hit the roads in Pittsburgh and San Francisco. But the year wasn't so good for all tech products. Let's recall the rise and fall of hoverboards and the ongoing saga of exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. Other products went more quietly into the night: The last ever VCR was manufactured in July. Here's a closer look at the tech products that hit the bucket in 2016. iPhone headphone jack Apple (AAPL, Tech30) killed off the jack in September in favor of wireless headphones. The move, which upset some of its loyal users, forced new iPhone 7 users to either use a dongle or invest in wireless headsets. The company also encouraged users to buy its wire-free (and futuristic-looking) set of earbuds,, AirPods ($160) The concept of wireless headsets might take time for a mass audience to accept, but it's a part of Apple's big effort to propel the audio market forward. In a few years, we'll likely look back on how weird it was that we once wore wires dangling from our ears. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Where do we even begin? Samsung faced a slew of challenges in 2016 but nothing hurt more than the nightmare that was the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. In October, Samsung (SSNLF) halted all production of the device following complaints that it burst into flames. This came after a badly mismanaged recall of 2.5 million Note 7s shortly after it launched. Now, you can't even bring one on a plane without being it taken away. Analysts believe the Note 7 debacle will put a $9.5 billion dent in sales and eliminate $5 billion in profits. Samsung also recalled 3 million of its washing machines this year due to an explosion risk. VCRs The last VCR manufacturer, Japanese company Funai Electric, ceased production of its video-cassette recorders in July. At its peak, the company sold 15 million VCRs in a year, but those numbers significantly dropped as DVDs, Blu-ray discs and, ultimately, streaming services hit the mainstream. Even so, Funai Electric still managed to sell 750,000 VCRs just last year. Considering the first VCRs were introduced in the 1960s, 50 years of production is still a solid run for any tech device. Hoverboards Hoverboards were the holiday gift of 2015, but this year wasn't quite as good to the self-balancing scooters. After reports of burns caused by exploding devices, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission deemed hoverboards unsafe. Retailers pulled them from stores, transportation agencies banned them from trains and buses, and, ultimately, more than 500,000 hoverboards were recalled. The devices' lithium-ion battery packs -- the same battery found in Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 smartphones -- were blamed for the incidents. Although hoverboards received a slight resurgence later in the year -- some manufacturers implemented more safety measurements -- the Consumer Product Safety Commission continues issue recalls. Pebble Pebble, once the darling of the smartwatch world, recently sold off its software division to fitness tracking company Fitbit. The news angered existing Pebble users -- without software updates, their devices would become obsolete. The deal, which cost $40 million, didn't include Pebble's hardware, but it appears the company won't be making more wearables. Reports indicate Pebble is pulling production on its Pebble Time 2 watch, which recently wrapped up a Kickstarter campaign. Early backers will receive refunds in the near future. Pebble was the first company to make a splash with smartwatches, long before the Apple Watch and Samsung Gear hit the market. Fitbit (FIT) will likely use Pebble's software assets to move beyond fitness tracking and into the smartwatch space. Microsoft's Sunrise app Microsoft's Sunrise app was ... well, sunsetted ... in 2016. The tech giant acquired the popular calendar app, known for its social features and sleep design, in October 2015. But less than a year later, Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) shuttered Sunrise and blended its features into Outlook, its email service. The new integration brings map integration and makes it easier to set up meetings and Skype calls directly within Outlook. Facebook's Paper app Facebook's Paper app -- which launched in 2014 -- was a unique, beautifully designed approach to displaying both articles and status updates in your news feed. Some even called it the future of reading news. But the app failed to get a loyal audience. Paper was best known for its Instant Articles feature, which allowed users to browse and download articles from popular media outlets directly to their phones. It was also a convenient place to check Facebook messages and your timeline without switching apps. But due to low user numbers, Facebook (FB, Tech30) mostly used it as a testing ground to quietly roll out new features. The social network shuttered the service on July 29. Apple's cinema displays This summer, Apple (AAPL, Tech30) discontinued its Thunderbolt Display, the company's only remaining standalone monitor. It was a favorite among among graphic designers, gamers and anyone who needed to connect a Mac computer to a larger display. But considering it hadn't received an update since 2011, the news wasn't much of a shock. Apple did, however, partner with LG to roll out 4K and 5K displays -- a pricier but better quality alternative. Google Picasa In March, Google (GOOGL, Tech30) pulled the plug on its photo-sharing and storing service Picasa. Google Photos debuted last year with a splashy launch, and running two similar services didn't make sense. Plus, Google Photos is a far superior product. Picasa attracted a loyal fan base over the years, allowing users to edit and organize digital photos long before the introduction of smartphone cameras. Users weren't happy about the service's demise, but Google made the transition as easy as possible; existing photos and albums are still accessible after logging into Google Photos. Motorola Lenovo (LNVGF) killed off the Motorola (MSI) name earlier this year. The parent company now blends the two brands together under a "Moto by Lenovo" moniker. Motorola, the company behind the first walkie-talkie and consumer cell phone, has had a rollercoaster-like few years. It's been bought and sold twice since 2012. In the first deal, Google acquired Motorola for $12.5 billion, which kicked off the search giant's step into the hardware business. But sales of the Moto X smartphone were sluggish, and Google eventually sold the company to Lenovo for $2.9 billion. For now, Moto's lineup includes smartphones, wearables and Bluetooth headsets. Google's Project Ara Although Google's modular Ara phone was expected to ship as early as the fall, the company is no longer bringing it to market. Google's experimental ATAP team spent more than three years developing the innovative concept that would allow people to design their own smartphones. By using small bricks that look like LEGOs, pieces could be swapped, removed or attached based on your preferences. But Project Ara, which underwent testing in Puerto Rico, was reportedly too costly and ran into a series of technical issues that kept it from hitting the mass market. BlackBerry phones BlackBerry (BBRY, Tech30), known for its cellphones with physical keyboards, is no longer making its own devices. The company announced in September that it will lean instead on partners to manufacture the phones, which will still resemble BlackBerry devices. Its main focus will be on developing software -- an effort BlackBerry introduced several years ago amid slow phone sales. Before the emergence of the iPhone, BlackBerry devices were so loved by their obsessed user base that they were nicknamed Crackberries. The phones were used by everyone from Kim Kardashian West to President Obama. Vine Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) announced in October it was shutting down its beloved short-form video app, Vine -- a move that upset its most loyal fans. But recently, the company announced plans to bring it back from the dead. Sort of. The parent company is rebranding the app as Vine Camera, allowing users to take photos and short clips that can be saved to a camera roll or shared on Twitter. Features such as built-in chat, likes and comments won't be included in the new version of the app. Vine was acquired by Twitter in 2012 for $30 million. Although capabilities were limited, it played an integral role in capturing movements like Black Lives Matter and gave aspiring artists such as Shawn Mendes -- now a bestselling pop artist -- a place to promote their brand.

The Macintosh was Apple’s bread and butter for so long, until the iPhone came along and turned computing on its head. Now it looks like the Mac line is slowly losing steam within Apple. Reports are circulating that Apple has diverted attention away from the Mac development team, who have gone through major personnel changes over the last few months and who are finding it hard to contact and work with the software team and with Jony Ive’s heavyweight design team. If you notice there, I said "software team". There isn't even a designated team within Apple just working on Mac software, it's one team doing all Apple software. It’s feeling like a slow death at this stage. The MacBook Pro, the signature Mac device Apple offers, went for 500 days without an update, and when it finally came in the form of the TouchBar, a lot of people were underwhelmed. That included the MacBook’s core audience of professionals who need more power from this supposedly professional notebook. Apple have been in a weird place with their Mac line over the last few years, and most of it is their own fault. They have sacrificed power and usability for design and form, and that’s not just the case with the Mac line, it’s across the board with Apple devices. A port problem Take a look at the latest MacBook Pro, with or without the TouchBar. The only ports included on it are USB Type C ports, which are far from being standard right now. For a “professional” computer, used by photographers who need an SD card port and artists you need HDMI monitors, that just doesn’t cut it. MacBook Pro with TouchBar It was also trimmed down to be even thinner, which makes no sense. At all. Don’t even defend it. It’s a professional computer, let it be thick, heavy, and have a huge battery. If you want thin, get a regular MacBook or an iPad. That’s an unnecessary move they did with their desktop iMac too, slicing it up for little reason. Before giving it an impressive 5K screen, the last big update saw it be thinned down into a wedge shape with sharp edges. If that’s attractive to you, that’s fine, there you go. But to most users, it’s something that won’t even be seen as the iMac is pushed up against a wall on a desk and left there. Mac Pro There are other reasons for Mac updates to be so delayed, including Intel not offering up the latest chips soon enough. That’s a fair point, but take the Mac Pro desktop computer. The “trashcan” hasn’t been updated since it came out in December 2013. Three years without a major update for a top-of-the-line computer is nonsense, and dangerous for the company. Core audience Apple have a core group of diehard fans who hang on every word the company says and every word the company releases. They live and die by Apple, yet there’s a growing rumble from them that they’re growing disenfranchised with the fruit-logo’d company. They’re worried they’re being left behind for the iOS devices, and now it sounds like their worst fears are being realised. If Apple wants to let the Mac die, so be it. But this near-comatose state it’s in is a worse fate than just being culled altogether. There’s other companies now making notebooks and desktops to an Apple standard, most notably Microsoft. Apple was streets ahead of the competition just a mere few years ago, but now they’ve caught up and even overtaken Apple in some cases. The problem Apple has now is trying to figure out if it just doesn’t know how to catch up, or if it even cares. Apple should care about the Mac though. It’s the only device that lets you develop and make iOS apps, and is a major anchor in Apple’s ensnaring ecosystem of devices and services. Should the Mac continue to flail about, it’ll cause a huge black hole in the daily work of an awful lot of people who make an awful lot of money for Apple by way of apps. I’ve written this article on a MacBook Pro, an older model with a full compliment of ports. It’s great, I love it dearly, but the way the platform is going, I suspect it may be the last MacBook I buy until Apple get their act together. Make a proper Mac again, Apple, you can do it. Throw the 13 billion you could’ve given Ireland to the Mac team, let them make Macs again. Believe me, it’ll be worth it. 13:52 27 Dec 2016 Kevin Kelly 6 days ago 3 Related articles Vestager says Apple's full tax bill may not be payable to Ireland Tech Predictions for 2017: From 10th anniversary iPhone to talking computers Nokia and Apple renew patent war most popular latest sport WATCH: Imelda May performs on Jools Holland's Hootenanny Government urged to pause home repossessions amid concern over legal process Evening top 5: Turkish authorities close in on News Year's Eve gunman; government urged to pause repossessions Premier League As It Happened: West Ham United vs. Manchester United site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Here's how Pandora hopes to maneuver its way to profitability. Tim Westergren [Photos: Damien Maloney for Fast Company] John Paul Titlow 04.26.16 8:00 AM For somebody who just got off of a red-eye flight across the country at six this morning, Tim Westergren seems strangely energized. Perhaps it's adrenaline. But it would be hard to blame him if there was a shred of terror in there, too. Two days earlier, Westergren had suddenly found himself with a new job: chief executive of Pandora, the Internet radio company he cofounded 16 years ago. Plenty has changed since the early days. After inventing personalized Internet radio as we know it, Pandora amassed more than 80 million users, went public on the U.S. stock market, quarreled with the music industry, made up with the music industry, acquired a few music startups—and integrated its radio service into 1,700 types of devices along the way. But there are some notable things Pandora has not done. It hasn’t become a hugely profitable company—most financial quarters, it reports a loss—and its core product has not changed all that dramatically, even as on-demand streaming has taken hold and competition has heated up. In the coming months, Pandora is getting ready to make some major changes to its product and business model—and it's praying that it all pays off. That’s why Westergren flew to New York from California this morning. The task ahead of him is hugely challenging—not to mention urgent. "It’s crystal clear to me what I should be doing," says Westergren, who replaces Brian McAndrews, who suddenly left the company in late March after two and a half years as CEO. "Both why I should be doing this as a job in the first place and what the most important things to tackle are." During his first week on the job, Westergren’s focus was on "rallying the troops" internally and meeting with two of Pandora’s most important constituencies—record labels and investors. Before this New York jaunt, he was in Los Angeles meeting with music label execs and artists. Before that, he hosted an all-hands meeting at the company’s headquarters in Oakland, unveiling a new org chart with his name at the top and refined roles for other members of the top brass. "I can’t remember the last time I slept a decent night’s sleep," Westergren says between bites of a sushi lunch that seems like it barely snuck into his packed afternoon. "But I’ve never been more fired up than I am now." That’s good, because Westergren has his work cut out for him. In 2015, the company failed to grow its audience beyond the 81 million listeners it had at the beginning of the year. And while it pulled in $1.16 billion in revenue last year, it was still $170 million short of profitability, thanks to its stubbornly huge, federally defined music licensing costs. Those fees, which don't apply to terrestrial radio or on-demand music services like Spotify, eat up roughly half of Pandora's revenue, making it hard to consistently turn a profit. The company may even be looking to sell itself off, according to a recent report in the New York Times. Even with Westergren now at the helm, that option may remain on the table—the company hasn’t officially commented on that. But right now, he seems sincerely hell-bent on breathing new life into this thing he helped build so many years ago. "There’s something about having been here from the very beginning," says Westergren. "I know how everything is stitched together. I know how things work. Why we do things. Where our weaknesses and strengths are." Even before its unexpected CEO swap, Pandora was busy charting a new course. Late last year, it acquired the remains of struggling Spotify competitor Rdio, concert ticket seller Ticketfly, and Next Big Sound, a startup that tracks music online and offers detailed analytics to artists and labels. The acquisitions signaled a two-pronged strategy: Turn Pandora into a more comprehensive, Spotify-esque place for listening to music, while also making it a more valuable (and hopefully lucrative) resource for musicians. The time line on launching these new initiatives, Westergren assures me, has not changed, although like any executive operating in the ever-fluctuating digital music space, he’s hesitant to give exact dates. "We want to be a one-stop shop for artists and for listeners," Westergren says. "And all that activity will turn into a set of businesses." And crucially, those businesses won’t all be eaten at by the same fixed (and very costly) royalty payments that Pandora's radio product endures. That isn’t to suggest that profits will explode once the switch is flipped, but if all goes according to plan, Pandora is hoping its road ahead could be a bit less bumpy. It’s tempting to view Westergren’s promotion like a Jack Dorsey moment: A publicly traded technology company struggling to grow its user base turns to its charismatic cofounder to help steer the ship through increasingly crowded and competitive waters. But perhaps if anybody can pull this off, it’s Westergren. He brings to the table what he sees as being two distinct advantages: past experience as a working musician—he believes it gives him a unique vantage point from which to court the music industry and artists—and a face that's very familiar inside the company. He may only have had this new job title for a few weeks, but Westergren has long been a hands-on cofounder and cheerleader for Pandora, serving as the public face of the company in the press, holding public town halls with listeners, and sitting in on sales calls with ad reps, among much else. Who better to lead the organization through trying times than somebody who naturally brims with enthusiasm for his own creation? Why Pandora Needs To Look More like Spotify If life is challenging for Pandora, it may have less to do with any missteps the company may have made over the years and more with forces that have sprung up all around it. Make no mistake about it: Pandora’s original concept—personalized online radio based on the tastes of its listeners and powered by an algorithm trained by living, breathing music experts—was a bona fide innovation when it premiered in 2005. It changed the way millions of people listen to music, spawned countless copycats, and cut into terrestrial radio’s share of airtime by nearly 10%. But in 2016, personalized radio alone just doesn’t cut it. As a business, it’s incredibly expensive to operate, and it's difficult to scale beyond the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand, thanks to the unique music licensing rules that govern Internet radio broadcasters. Meanwhile, listeners’ expectations have changed since Pandora's heydey. The rise of on-demand services like Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music have given people more control over their listening experience, allowing them to find and play whatever tracks they want, when they want. Through playlists and various flavors of human-meets-machine algorithmic intelligence, these services offer music curation and personalization, as well, and a radio feature of some kind is usually bolted onto their on-demand music experience. It's no wonder Pandora’s growth has stalled. Last year, digital music made more money than physical albums for the first time, fueled by an explosion in streaming. In December, even the famously new-format-shy Beatles released their entire catalog on all the major streaming services. And just this month, Kanye West’s Life of Pablo became the first album to hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts without selling any physical copies. Pandora is still exceptionally adept at delivering the artist- and song-based radio stations it pioneered. But for many, refining their station with the thumbs-up button alone isn’t enough. When you hear something you like on Pandora, you likely head off to YouTube, SoundCloud, Apple Music, or Spotify to save your newly discovered jam. "We don’t want you to do that," says Westergren. That’s why Pandora has been working on new options for its users. In early 2014, Pandora’s chief financial officer Mike Herring met up with Sara Clemens, a former Microsoft executive who led business development and international expansion for the Xbox. Over lunch, the pair discussed Pandora’s unique set of challenges and opportunities as a business. Sara ClemensPhoto: Eric Millette "Both of us were very aligned about this chance to create a scaled music marketplace," says Clemens, who would soon join Pandora as its chief strategy officer. "A place where fans and artists could connect at an unprecedented scale. What are the services you’d need to build to create the most delightful experience for both of those groups?" By mid-2014, Clemens and other members of Pandora's leadership met with the teams at Ticketfly, Next Big Sound, and Rdio and began mapping out a new, more ambitious future for the company. The company's previous experiments helping artists plot tours and sell tickets suggested that Pandora could play a new, unique role in the live music side of the industry. In mid-2015, Pandora teamed up with the Rolling Stones to help promote an upcoming tour—and managed to presell 55,000 tickets in 24 hours. The partnership, which came about from an existing advertising relationship with the band's tour promotion company, demonstrated how Pandora's reach and technology could be used to sell tickets directly to fans. Surely, that process could be made even smoother if Pandora owned the ticket-selling platform itself. Meanwhile, earlier discussions with Next Big Sound about including Pandora as one of the analytics company's many data partners had evolved into a conversation, instead, about Pandora buying Next Big Sound to enhance its own suite of self-service, data-powered tools for artists. For its part, Rdio was struggling to keep up with Spotify and Apple Music, reportedly losing $2 million per month and barreling toward bankruptcy. With many in the music industry loudly railing against free, ad-supported music and Pandora looking for new sources of revenue, Rdio's assets—chiefly, its technology stack, product team, engineers, and business affairs group—seemed well worth the $75 million Pandora would drop to scoop them up. That might seem counterintuitive, given that on-demand streaming isn't a wildly profitable business either. But unlike with radio, on-demand music lets Pandora directly negotiate licensing deals with the labels—and experiment with subscription business models. Later this year, Pandora will launch its own on-demand music subscription service, once the licensing deals and logistical and design details are all ironed out. It’s easy to envision a Spotify clone layered on top of the existing Pandora app. But there’s more to it than that, insists Chris Phillips, Pandora’s chief product officer and the man overseeing the process of integrating these new pieces—an on-demand library, ticket-selling features, and a fresh arsenal of data—into the Pandora puzzle. "We're tackling it differently," says Phillips, arguing that most music streaming services start with a huge on-demand library and then tack on personalized radio and curated playlists as an afterthought. "We're starting from this very simplistic personalized radio, and we'll be adding in the right level of control in the right places." Pandora knows, for instance, if you’re into Carly Rae Jepsen. Maybe the Carly Rae station is your guilty pleasure at work. Or perhaps you’ve repeatedly hit the thumbs-up button on her songs when you hear them on Pandora stations. Armed with this intel, Pandora can confidently dangle her latest album in front of you, hoping to lure you toward the on-demand service subscribe button. The trick will be elegantly layering these pitches into the experience without annoying listeners. Chris Phillips "You can think of any number of ways in which we would auto-complete your virtual music collection," says Westergren, suggesting that teasing listeners with a Spotify-style list of albums might help show casual, "lean back" radio listeners the value of paying up. Tricks like this may help Pandora reach its stated goal of converting 10% of its Internet radio listeners (that's 8.1 million people) to paying on-demand subscribers. And for existing Pandora listeners who haven’t yet invested in another $10-per-month music service, why not? It’s the people already hooked on Spotify or Apple Music who will be harder to convince. Indeed, catching up to Spotify and Apple's combined 40 million paying subscribers will undoubtedly be an uphill battle for Pandora, which is admittedly jumping into the on-demand subscription game very late. Just look at Tidal, which struggled to amass 3 million subscribers even after coaxing fans with exclusives from top-tier artists like Rihanna and Kanye West. To its credit, Pandora is trying to build more than just another Spotify copycat. For one thing, Clemens tells me, the company is not going to stick strictly with the all-you-can-stream-for-10-bucks model that dominates music subscription services today. "One of the things that the industry has done to its detriment over the years is create this $120 price cap irrespective of how much people love music," says Clemens, referring to the yearly price tag affixed to all-you-can-stream services like Spotify. "If I look at the gaming industry for example, people are willing to spend thousands if they’re a superfan." Pandora already has 3.9 million subscribers for its Pandora One tier, which eliminates advertisements from its online radio streams. The company won't comment on how Pandora One will be affected by the new on-demand offerings. But whatever the pricing details may be, Clemens and Westergren clearly envision multiple price tiers that cater to fans of varying levels of intensity. "What does it look like if they rent access to the new album for a period?" wonders Clemens. "Or for the price in the market, would you like to be able to buy it and listen to it unlimited? Or you’re a superfan and there’s a presale going on for the gig that’s going to be in your town. Would you like to know ahead of time? What’s the premium you’re willing to pay for that?" The impending launch of its on-demand service might also help Pandora position itself to expand into other countries, depending on the details of the deals that are now being negotiated with record labels. The compulsory licensing scheme used by Pandora radio in the U.S. doesn't easily translate overseas, but direct deals with labels as part of the new on-demand initiative may well help unclog one of the company's biggest bottlenecks toward growth. The company won’t commit to any time lines on when it might launch overseas, but doing so is clearly a pressing priority for Westergren. Spotify already operates in more than 60 countries, while Apple Music is available in 113. At this point, even an aggressive international expansion won't solve Pandora's challenges overnight. But when pressed on the question of competition in the on-demand space, Westergren goes right back to his magic number: 81 million active listeners. "That’s our strategic advantage," he insists. "We can take an existing audience and put the product in front of them in a really compelling way. And that’s our pitch to the music industry, too. You want to convert the masses? We’re the ones who can do it, in the U.S. at least." Frustrated by the popularity of free on-demand music options from Spotify and YouTube (whose ad revenue doesn't yield nearly as much cash for labels and artists as paid subscriptions do), the music industry will happily embrace any partner that can push listeners toward a payment button. The question is whether Pandora can cobble together enough unique perks to make it worth users' while. Can Pandora Become Ticketmaster For The Little Guy? For many artists, touring makes them more money than selling recorded music. In the streaming era, this sobering reality only becomes more real, especially for the middle class of musicians without major label marketing muscle. Indeed, the economics of streaming music—be it ad supported or subscription—does not usually favor these artists financially. While the business math of the new ecosystem shakes out, many argue, musicians simply need to scrape dollars together elsewhere, however they can—from merchandise, from synch licensing deals for TV and movies, and from playing live. If hitting the road is indeed a bigger piece of the sustainability pie for musicians, Pandora is busy positioning itself to play an important role. Its Ticketfly acquisition hits a sweet spot for the company. It’s a new source of revenue (a cut of ticket sales) unfixed to steep, legally defined royalty costs. It’s also a way for Pandora to aid artists in a direct, potentially hugely beneficial way. And for listeners faced with a range of streaming service options, it could be a big perk. Ticketfly will allow Pandora to do something that its competitors don't: sell concert tickets directly to fans within its music app. Using its existing data-powered personalization, Pandora wants to intelligently target concert ticket sales, including presales and special VIP passes, to the people who are most likely to buy them. Those offers can come in the form of in-stream advertising (smartly placed after a song by the artist who is touring) or as push notifications aimed at superfans the moment a show is announced. If the design of the recently launched Ticketfly mobile app is any indication, the ticket-buying experience itself will be nearly effortless. "One of the reasons we actually bought Ticketfly versus just partnering is that we want to tighten up the actual full process," explains Phillips. "From discovering the ticket to actually purchasing it and making it really easy." Anyone who has ever tried to buy a concert ticket on their phone will appreciate what Phillips and his team are trying to do here. If Pandora is really able to make the ticket buying experience as painless as possible, it would not only be a good thing for users, but could be a potential boon for artists and venues. Ticketfly serves small- to medium-sized venues, which often take a gamble on booking smaller acts, whether they be local bands or somebody touring from out of town. Pandora’s personalization technology can help sell tickets that otherwise may not have been sold, including to people who may not even realize they want to see that band play live, but are nonetheless dropping a hint every time they tap the thumbs-up button. For shows that might not be coming to your town (or might not be at a Ticketfly venue), Pandora is plotting a second phase to its live music strategy: live-streaming. Pandora has already run pilot live streams with acts such as G-Eazy, Fall Out Boy, Jack White, and Mumford and Sons, which Philips says were "wildly successful." Pandora's product team is plotting a greater emphasis on live-streamed shows, which could be targeted to fans based on their tastes. It wouldn't be the first time a company offered fans the option to tune into concerts live, but the combination of Pandora's size and listener-targeting capabilities could make it another compelling add-on for music fans. If the company is successful in attracting an audience to these live events, both virtual and in the flesh, they could generate not only a new source of income for Pandora (the company is mum on which features fall on which side of its upcoming paywalls), but also something that is just as valuable: more data. It’s All About The Data The company's Internet radio service was built atop Pandora’s Music Genome data set, which was created by dozens of musicologists who sat down with their headphones on and manually tagged songs with descriptive terms based on style, instrumentation, and various musical nuances. By wrapping thousands of songs in detailed metadata, the Music Genome Project allowed Pandora to create an algorithm that could link songs together by their stylistic and sonic attributes and then, crucially, start learning about its listeners' musical preferences. Every time a listener hit the thumbs-up or thumbs-down button on a song, they taught the system something new about their tastes. That intelligence was used to personalize stations for individual listeners and helped train Pandora's system about the relationships between artists, songs, and listeners across its platform. What Amazon and Netflix did for horror films and hand soap—the classic "people who like that also like this" recommendation engine—Pandora trained its system to do for songs. "Being CEO is like managing my band. It’s got all the same things. The chances of success are almost zero. It’s a creative endeavor with lots of artistic differences. You’re poor as shit." As Pandora grew, so too did its data science and personalization muscle. For millions of listeners, this formula made a lot more sense than the one-to-many model of terrestrial radio, which had historically jammed a narrow selection of popular music down the throats of the masses. Over time, Pandora’s underlying methodology was amended with new moving parts: machine listening to help scale the work of the musicologists and, at the same time, a new tier of flesh-and-blood curators to add another layer of human touch to the experience. Now Pandora is sitting on a massive (and potentially lucrative) mountain of data about its listeners, and 9 billion user-created stations and 65 billion taps of the thumb buttons have taught Pandora’s artificial brain quite a lot. On average, a Pandora user listens to more than 20 hours of music per month. As powerful as all that data is, it’s limited by the same thing inhibiting Pandora’s user experience: Its ability to learn hits a wall as soon as users switch over to Spotify, SoundCloud, or Apple Music to save songs for on-demand listening later or to explore entire albums and playlists at will. This is a big competitive vulnerability for Pandora, especially as Spotify releases its own innovative, data-powered music curation features like Fresh Finds and Discover Weekly. The science that powers these features (as well as Spotify’s own customized radio stations) comes from the Echo Nest, the music intelligence company Spotify acquired in 2014. The Echo Nest, which takes a slightly different, more machine-oriented stab at curation and discovery, is not quite as good as Pandora when it comes to personalized radio. But it’s quickly catching up. In the meantime, Spotify features like Discover Weekly are proving to be a big hit among listeners, giving them one less reason to open up the Pandora app. Meanwhile, Apple Music’s hand-built playlists and decidedly old school Beats One radio station have wowed listeners and generated a hip sort of buzz that must make an aging Internet radio pioneer feel jealous. By shifting toward on-demand subscriptions, Pandora is hoping to add a new, much deeper layer of data and understanding to its artificial brain. By creating artist-based stations and thumbing songs, listeners can teach Pandora a lot—but behaviors like saving albums and listening to them on repeat or adding individual songs to playlists are vastly more informative (as Spotify and Apple already know). Right now, if you're obsessed with the new Rihanna album, Pandora has no idea. These are the types of blind spots the service needs to fill in, especially if it wants to target superfans with special perks. Data is just as crucial when it comes to selling concert tickets. Not only will Pandora know what music you like to listen to, it will also learn which artists motivate you to spend your disposable income on tickets, get off your couch, and go see a show in person. That level of commitment says so much more than the tap of a thumbs-up button does. And that sort of intelligence will be hard for other music services to replicate without a ticket-selling service of their own. With these acquisitions, Pandora is attempting to bolt on fresh sources of revenue, but they shouldn't be seen as a shift away from radio. In fact, all these new data pipelines could funnel back into the service’s core algorithm, making the brain behind Pandora’s ad-supported radio service even smarter and, the company hopes, more lucrative. Tim Westergren and Chris Phillips Winning The Hearts And Minds Of Musicians Tim Westergren is fond of recalling his days as a touring musician. It’s not just that he’s nostalgic about lugging gear between venues with Yellowwood Junction, the acoustic rock outfit in which he played keyboard in the mid-1990s. Rather, he believes that his experience as an artist gives Pandora a unique perspective, especially now that he’s the company’s CEO. He might not have quite the music industry cred of Apple Music's Jimmy Iovine or Tidal's Jay-Z, but he can at least speak the language of the people who make music, who are sometimes deeply skeptical of anyone with the word "executive" in their title. "Being CEO is like managing my band," says Westergren. "It’s got all the same things. The chances of success are almost zero. It’s a creative endeavor with lots of artistic differences. You’re poor as shit. You’ve got financial stress. It’s the same thing." This narrative smacks of hip corporate spin, but it’s hard to dismiss when you look at Pandora’s recent strategy, which helps serve artists with new tools and opportunities. That was true when Westergren was merely a cofounder—and the company's focus on the needs of artists is bound to get even sharper now. In late 2014, Pandora launched its Artist Marketing Platform (AMP), partially under the guidance of then-cofounder Westergren. Through AMP’s dashboard, artists and managers can get a Google Analytics-style breakdown of the locations where their music is being played, how many new Pandora stations are being created from their songs, and how many listens and thumbs each song gets. Last month, the company launched AMPcast, which lets artists record their own self-promotional audio messages on their phone and target the audio (and an accompanying display ad) directly to fans. In one beta campaign, a small string quartet used AMPcast to advertise their new boxed set of CDs with a link to purchase—and made $3,000 in 20 minutes. In another campaign, EDM artist Steve Aoki used AMPcast to help promote an album that was premiering exclusively on Pandora. That ad saw a nearly 18% click-through rate, handily putting most banner campaigns and social ads to shame. "I think it was our most successful album launch we’ve ever done," says Matt Colon, cofounder of Deckstar Management, which manages Aoki and several other big name artists. Colon says his company plans on utilizing Pandora more as the service's artist-focused tools mature. Until recently, he says, they had no idea what kind of reach Pandora had into the fan bases of artists like Aoki. "I’m as guilty as everyone else of underestimating them," says Colon. "But when I saw the numbers, I was blown away. There’s a lot of functionality that we didn’t know existed." Indeed, artists are often surprised to see how much their music gets heard on Pandora. At a recent dinner with music executives in L.A., Westergren bumped into pop music heartthrob Nick Jonas and, quite naturally, proceeded to show him Pandora’s new promotional tools. Querying the data, Westergren found that Jonas’s music had been heard by 31 million listeners on Pandora, 1.7 million of whom made radio stations based on his music, much to Jonas's surprise. "Eighty percent of these top artists have far more people on Pandora who have created a radio station using their name than they have Twitter followers," claims Westergren. "This is where their audience is." When Pandora launched AMP, Alex White saw it as an excuse to try his luck one more time. For years, the founder of Next Big Sound was dying to get Pandora’s listener data into his startup’s music analytics dashboard, which helps artists and labels visualize and understand their online presence and popularity. But unlike SoundCloud, Spotify, and YouTube, Pandora was shy about sharing its data with third parties like Next Big Sound. "Pandora was always our biggest blind spot in terms of consumption and they never shared their data with anybody," says White. With AMP, that was clearly starting to change. Sure enough, Pandora was open to the idea of licensing its data to Next Big Sound and allowing the startup to flesh out its visualization-heavy artist dashboards with details on the service’s millions of monthly song plays. As Pandora’s AMP team worked with White’s small army of data wizards on the details, the two product’s similarities—and Next Big Sound’s value to the music industry—quickly became obvious to Pandora’s top brass. Before long, the conversation morphed from a data licensing negotiation into acquisition talks. Since the acquisition, some partners like SoundCloud and Spotify have pulled their data from Next Big Sound for obvious competitive reasons. But NBS still scrapes music-related info from Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, Instagram, Vine, YouTube, and—of course—Pandora. Its data also powers social music charts for Billboard, a relationship that remains unchanged by the acquisition. By snatching up Next Big Sound, Pandora extends its already massive data operation outside the walls of its own service and arms its product team and playlisting engine with a whole new set of insights about how music is shared and discussed online. Don’t be surprised if you start to see Pandora turn this intelligence into new music discovery features aimed at reclaiming the territory now being threatened by Spotify and Apple. More than anything, Next Big Sound makes Pandora a more useful platform for musicians and labels, for whom detailed, multifaceted data can unlock new, useful insights that can help artists make decisions, such as where they should book their next tour. In an era when the economic viability of being a musician seems so uncertain, anything that removes friction, frees up creative energy, or sells empty seats can go a long way. Will It Work? From a business perspective, Pandora’s new strategies are anything but a silver bullet. If executed well, they could help close the gap on its balance sheet and open up new, more flexible financial possibilities. But once the switch is flipped on these new products and integrations, the hard work will have only just begun. Both Westergren and Clemens seem to understand that. Simply marketing its new services will be a major feat, even with its already captive audience. To help, the company is currently searching for a new chief marketing officer to replace Simon Fleming-Wood, who stepped down shortly after Westergren took over as CEO.

"When we built this product, I was 26 and I said to myself, ‘What do I need?'’ says Westergren, recalling the days when he thought his career would unfold in concert halls rather than corporate offices. For a small-time band like his in the mid-1990s, getting radio airplay was unthinkable. As a touring band without the backing of a major label, plotting shows, promoting them, and selling tickets was an uphill battle. For thousands of bands today, it still is. "That’s the frame that we bring to this. This is something that your average musician can use. And if it’s not, then it’s a waste of fucking time. It’s another product built by some software engineer or a music fanatic who doesn’t know what it’s like to be an artist." If Pandora is serious about becoming a full-service marketplace for fans and artists alike, then we likely haven't seen the last of its big moves. For example, another potential opportunity is e-commerce. When asked whether Pandora plans to move toward selling artist merchandise directly to fans like Bandcamp or Band Page, Westergren and Clemens hint that this is something they're open to exploring in the future. Indeed, it's easy to speculate how a startup like Bandcamp, which serves many of the same middle-class artists as Ticketfly, might make for a logical acquisition down the road, considering its huge trove of buzzworthy, under-the-radar music, its e-commerce marketplace, and its beloved status among the sort of artists that Pandora seeks to serve—though the company did not discuss with me whether such an aquisition is a real possibility. Certainly, the company has plenty of work ahead of itself as is. To truly thrive—and avoid having to sell itself off—Pandora needs to do exactly what it appears to be trying to do: branch out. Its future isn't a sure bet, but it's hard to imagine that Pandora is finished rewiring itself just yet. App photo: Ivy Close Images/Alamy Never miss a story.

A couple of years later, Oxner and fellow swimmer Fares Ksebati came up with a solution that helped swimmers of all ability levels achieve their fitness goals through the development of the MySwimPro app. The app has since garnered praise from Apple as the Apple Watch App of the Year while earning 100,000 users since launching in 2015. "Friends were asking us for help writing workouts and offered to compensate us for our time to help them reach their goals," Oxner said. "That's when we knew we had identified a problem worth solving. "MySwimPro was originally designed for swimmers who don't have access to a coach or team," he added. "That could be someone who swims 300 yards a week at their local YMCA for fitness to a more serious athlete training for their 10th triathlon." The fitness app was developed through U-M's Desai Accelerator, which is managed by the U-M College of Engineering's Center for Entrepreneurship and the Ross School of Business' Samuel Zell and Robert H. Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies. App of the Year picks are chosen by the Apple Store editors to showcase the best and most popular apps available, in addition to other categories like music and movies. MySwimPro -- the first swimming app designed for the Apple Watch -- helps swimmers achieve their fitness goals by delivering customizable workouts, instructional video content and advanced analytics through a training log. The app coaches users through workouts set by set and syncs with a corresponding iPhone app, which features hundreds of swim workouts varying in skill level, stroke category and workout duration. The app has videos to help swimmers work on technique, with workouts ranging in difficulty from beginner level up to advanced level, featuring 8,000 meter workouts. MySwimPro recently added social features to keep users motivated to reach their goals. Oxner, the iOS lead for MySwimPro, said developers of the app worked hard to leverage Apple's existing HealthKit technology to create a unique experience for swimmers, designed by swimmers. "Swimmers are always looking for ways to improve. We want to make that process easier and more efficient," Oxner said. "Swimmers love trying out new solutions to help them improve because there aren't a lot of solutions in the market that are catered to their needs. We are always implementing suggestions that we get from athletes on MySwimPro." Desai was specifically founded to help ventures as they reach the critical phase between early-stage development and the point at which they seek external investment. "Desai was designed to enable early stage companies to transition from incubation to fundable enterprises," Desai Managing Director Kelly LaPierre said in an email. "Our fixed-term, cohort-based program including mentorship and educational components designed to provide startups with critical resources to help them make rapid progress on product and customer development. Additionally, we invested capital in MySwimPro and provided them access to our talented University of Michigan student interns." In addition to Desai, MySwimPro received help from four-time Olympic medalist and U-M alum Peter Vanderkaay, who advised the app's development. Having experienced swimmers like Oxner, Vanderkaay and CEO Ksebati, who swam at Wayne State University, involved in the development of the app is what makes MySwimPro so user-friendly LaPierre said. "The team behind MySwimPro understands this problem first-hand and has the credibility as swimmers in order to effectively build a solution," she said. "Their extremely talented designers and developers are able to create a tech solution that is both simple and functional, yet beautiful." Oxner said Desai provided the support he and Ksebati needed to make its initial push into the market, while providing them with the necessary connections they needed as a startup. "The Michigan Accelerator helped us expand our network across the country and get connected to key organizations that can help us move the needle like Ann Arbor Spark," Oxner said. "It's great having a support network of like-minded entrepreneurs that encouraged us to take risks and get through the more difficult portions of running a startup."

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple says it will work with Consumer Reports to isolate potential battery issues found in 2016 MacBook Pro Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, December 27th, 2016, 05:08 Category: battery, Google, Hardware, MacBook Pro, News, Software Following up on Consumer Reports refusal for the first time to recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro due to inconsistent battery life, it looks like Apple will be working with the publication to try to sort out potential issues with the battery. “Working with [Consumer Reports] to understand their battery tests,” Apple Vice President of Worldwide Marking Phil Schiller tweeted. “Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.” Apple claims its internal testing has seen the new MacBook Pro providing up to 10 hours of battery life when watching iTunes movies or browsing the web. Consumer Reports’ test has come under scrutiny since publication of the non-recommendation. The tests were conducted by opening a series of 10 web pages sequentially on Safari. This tests’ inconsistency had the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar registering 16 hours, 12.75 hours and 3.75 hours of battery life. A 15-inch MacBook Pro ranged from 18.5 hours to 8 hours of battery life. The Consumer Reports tests appear to have focused heavily on using Google Chrome as the default web browser as opposed to Apple’s Safari. Chrome has been criticized as something of a battery hog by some users, making this a point of contention. “For this exercise, we ran two trials on each of the laptops, and found battery life to be consistently high on all six runs,” the report said. Consumer Reports did not think it was enough data to draw a conclusion, though they also point out their test results only take default browsers into consideration. Consumer Reports noted in its report that if Apple issues a software update that it claims will fix battery life inconsistency, they will conduct fresh tests. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Download “Yalu iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak” For 64-Bit iOS 10 Devices by Sarah • December 27, 2016 December 27, 2016 in Apple Famous Italian Hackers PanGu and Todesco released the iOS 10 Jailbreak tool named Yalu iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak. You can now download the Yalu + Mach_Portal iOS 10.1.1 jailbreak for your iPhone 7/ 6S and iPad Pro. The Famous Italian hacker, Luca Todesco released the iOS 10 jailbreak like he had already promised. However, the Cupertino tech giant is working hard to foil the jailbreaking attempts of Pangu and Luca Todesco. Todesco has insisted that we downgrade to iOS 10.1.1 to take advantage of the Yalu iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak. Hence, Apple has discontinued the iOS 10.1.1 version in its attempts to foil the jailbreak. ADVERTISEMENT Yalu iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak for Selected 64-Bits Devices You will be able to use the Yalu iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak only on 64- Bit devices. 32-Bit iOS devices do not have the Yalu jailbreak support so far. According to the reports from Redmond Pie, You can download the Yalu iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak on Apple’s select 64-bit devices like iPhone 7series, iPhone 6S series and iPad Pro only. You will not be able to run the jailbreak on other 32-bit devices like the iPhone 5 series, iPhone 4 series and the iPad and iPod touch. Downgrade to iOS 10.1.1 To Jail Break Your Device You will have to downgrade to iOS 10.1.1 in order to use Todesco’s jailbreak. It is tough to overcome the iOS 10.2 version. However, Apple has disabled the signing in for iOS 10.1.1 update after the release of Yalu iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak which works fine on the selected 64-bit devices which run on iOS 10.1.1. You should also remember that this jailbreak tool is partially untethered. Hence, you will have to re-jail break your device every time you rebook. Other iOS 10 Jailbreak Requirements You will also need the Yalu IPA file for making the iOS jailbreak tool work. Also, download the Cydia Impactor available on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Disable the touch ID and Passcode lock on your device. Install iTunes on your PC or Mac to get your device ready for the iOS 10 jailbreak. As the Yalu iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak is just the first beta version, you will not be able to find a perfect tool yet. ADVERTISEMENT Although Pangu has already demonstrated one, the jailbreak tool for iOS 10.2, is currently unavailable. The tool is not public yet, as Todesco insists that the secure option is to take the iOS 10.1.1 downgrade. Apple Stops iOS 10.1.1 To Foil Jail Breaking However if you have upgraded to iOS 10.2, it is unfortunate that you won’t be able to use the iOS 10 jailbreak tool. Apple on the other had is taking serious steps to bridge the gaps in firmware security. Jailbreaking is against the Apple’s policies. Hence, you will no longer be entitled to the protection services the company offers in case you jailbreak your device. This is also the reason why Apple is working hard to ensure the security of the non-jailbreak devices. However, the key intention behind iOS jailbreak is to offer the power of customization like other OS devices. Apple’s closed system does not allow for personalization of tools and settings. Fans of jailbreaking, can download the Yalu iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak and enjoy the customization features.

Michael Markowski, in his recent analysis states that Apple has the highest market value (of $621.32 billion as of December 27), followed by Alphabet ($557 billion), and Microsoft coming in at $491.71 billion. Despite those figures, he is foreseeing that Redmond will soon lead the charge. Explaining why, he first points out Microsoft's free cash flow yield, which is reportedly the highest of all the contenders. Secondly, the LinkedIn acquisition expands the company's price/earnings (P/E) multiple. Lastly, Markowski sees that Microsoft will play a key part in social investing community (SIC), which will help make online equity crowdfunding ubiquitous. According to him, the goal will be reached by making LinkedIn a leader when it comes to social media, as well as being a pioneer in the crowdfunding industry. Furthermore, Markowski predicts that crowdfunding will become the next digital innovation, coming after smartphones and apps. The evolution of the first two major digital innovations enabled the shareholders of Amazon, Google and Facebook to build dynasty wealth from what would be become the world's most valuable public companies. The third digital innovation, the smartphone app enabled Airbnb, Uber and Snapchat to become the world's most valuable private companies. The fourth, online equity crowdfunding provides Microsoft with a significant advantage to become the first company to get to a trillion-dollar market cap. Capping off his analysis, Markowski predicts that the social media industry will help drive online equity crowdfunding in the future. "The SIC industry is in its infancy," he said.

This time the Japanese outlet Macotakara leaked an image of the alleged iPhone 7s or whatever Apple ends up naming the updated version of the latest Apple iPhone 7. The most interesting part of their leak is the placement of the dual camera. The sensors are still on the upper-left corner but are placed vertically rather than the horizontally as in the iPhone 7 Plus. Sources also report that the flagship would sport a 5 display and the Plus version would be with 5.8-inch display. iPhone 7 Plus - the only dual-camera smartphone by Apple Specifications are unclear up to this point and all the rumors reveal only external details like all-glass design, wireless charging and OLED display. Of course this isnt the first time weve heard any of these suggestions. Next year Apple is celebrating 10 years since the first iPhone launch so we are expecting a leap forward rather than another small step.

USA TODAY NES Classic is one of the season's biggest tech gifts. (Photo: Nintendo) The biggest gift-giving days of the year packed your pockets with all the latest gadgets and gizmos. Now what? Here are some tips to get the most mileage from your new tech toys. Update, update, update! No matter what digital device you found under the tree, there’s a good chance it’s not fully up to date with the latest software and security features. Grab that shiny new phone, laptop, tablet, or camera and head into the settings menu in search of the latest update. Some gadgets, like phones and computers, automatically alert you when a new update is available, but not always, so it pays to double check. Never buy batteries This habit is a hard one to break, but it’ll pay off in the long run. Toss those disposable coppertops and go the rechargeable route. Six or seven years ago when they first hit the market, rechargeable batteries were way too expensive to consider as an option. That's changed. You can score a 16-pack of these never-say-die batteries for $25.99 on Amazon, and recharging them is as simple as plugging them into cheap charging dock. Forget your password That new smartphone or tablet you have on the coffee table probably has more app logins than you expected, so keep privacy and security top of mind and take the time to install a password manager like 1Password or LastPass. These handy little tools keep all your passwords safe and encrypted, and auto-fills them whenever you need, so you don’t have to memorize a dozen different combinations just to keep hackers at bay. Both are free to try and premium plans are as little as $1 per month, which is a small price to pay for the ultimate safety net. USA TODAY Weekend project: Update your passwords Google it If you're having a tech problem, others problem have as well -- and have posted the results.  (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) Don’t let a malfunctioning gadget or impossible-Bluetooth-pairing get you down. If you’re having any issues with a digital device, from an iPhone to an electric grill, Google is your friend. Everyone is quick to call tech support, but what makes Google so great is that if you’re having a problem right now, there’s a good chance someone else already had that problem before and figured out how to fix, and is ready to help you do the same. Simple Google searches like “program universal remote” or “iPad won’t connect to wifi” instantly gives you multiple sources to fast-track your fix, and you won’t have to wait on hold or in line at an Apple store for a solution. USA TODAY Q&A: Get to the top of Google search results And now, to 2017... Tech never sleeps, and it won’t be long before we have a whole new rush of gadgets battling each other for a chance to end up in your home. Here are some of the biggest tech products and trends on the horizon to give you a taste for what’s in store in 2017: A big year for Apple   Rumors around the expected iPhone 8 include a sharp OLED screen and curved glass.  (Photo: Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY) My predictions: after a lackluster 2016, Apple is going to pull out all the stops to make 2017 one to remember. The iPhone 8 will be the biggest change in years, and there’s lots of insider info that says the new iPhone will have a super sharp OLED, curved glass, and even a hidden home button integrated right into the display. On the computer front, Apple updated the MacBook Pro this fall, but a lot of the other Macs are still waiting to get their own time to shine. Expect a big Apple event early in 2017 with all-new updates for the iMac and hopefully a new Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and lots of other Apple goodies. Virtual reality grows up Google's new Daydream VR headset and controller.  (Photo: Google) I spent a ton of time testing out virtual reality gadgets this fall, and many more are on the way in 2017. Microsoft is about to roll new Windows 10 VR headsets from different manufacturers. The new gadgets are expected to start at around $299, much cheaper than the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. So if you haven’t taken the VR plunge yet, it’s about to be downright irresistible. Amazon’s big gamble To compete with Netflix, Amazon is already beefing up its streaming video service with a ton of original content like Transparent and Man In The High Castle. Expect Amazon to push this into overdrive in 2017. And let’s not forget about Alexa, Amazon’s do-it-all virtual assistant that runs the Echo and other gadgets. Amazon has hinted Alexa will play an even bigger role in smart home gadgets coming soon. Rufus Sewell on Amazon's 'The Man in the High Castle.'  (Photo: Liane Hentscher) Do or die for smart homes Speaking of smart home tech, it’s not just Amazon that’s knocking at your door; Apple, Google, and plenty of other companies are making a big push to outfit your house with tech. By the end of the year we’ll know whether “smart” appliances and assistants are really all they’re cracked up to be, or if the entire industry needs a massive reboot. Hit the road Things are also heating up in the smart car market, and it’s moving faster than ever. With smart car add-ons that turn any vehicle into a wise road warrior, it’s clear that there’s plenty of interest, now it’s up to car makers to integrate the tech. Several cities are already passing autonomous driving laws and regulations, and even if your car doesn’t drive itself by the end of 2017, it’s probably going to be a lot smarter than it is today. Nintendo Switch Nintendo’s new game system is half home console, half handheld gaming powerhouse, and it’s like nothing anyone has seen before. Nintendo is promising beloved game characters like Zelda and Mario will grace the system early on, and if you can take it with you on the bus and still play it on your big TV at home, expect the Switch to be a huge hit when it lands in March. Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung really needs to knock a new smartphone out of the park after the whole exploding Note 7 drama, and the S8 is already sounding like it’ll be a huge milestone. Lots of rumors are swirling that the phone will have a bezel-free display, so the screen stretches from edge to edge. It sounds awesome, and Samsung is expected to go all out with a huge launch early in the year. Xbox Project Scorpio Gaming fans, get excited, because Microsoft’s super-powerful new game console is just around the corner, too. The new Xbox is expected to be much more capable than the Xbox One, and with full 4K support and HDR, the games will look sharp. Microsoft has been teasing this one for a while, and while there’s no official release date, you can expect to hear much more about it as 2017 gets underway.

Driverless cars like the AG F015 may make current car brands less important to consumers. (Bloomberg file photo) Driverless cars may endanger some brands By: Bloomberg News December 27, 2016 7:01 am 0 When cars drive themselves, passengers may not care if they ride in a Chevy or a Ford. After a century of building automotive brands based on how they drive, carmakers face an existential threat in the coming age of autonomy. If a customer no longer pilots a vehicle, the marque of its maker may become irrelevant. After all, most people don’t reserve a flight because it’s on a Boeing or an Airbus, so automakers are trying to turn today’s cars into a connected extension of the home or office to keep their names vital. “In the long term, automotive brands are gone,” said retired General Motors Vice Chairman Bob Lutz, 84, who green-lighted BMW’s “The Ultimate Driving Machine” slogan when he ran global marketing for the German automaker in the 1970s. “If you get on a city bus or an airplane, do you care who made it? There won’t be anything left to car brands in 20 years.” Any diminution of automotive brands would be a seismic shift for the industry. Car companies have derived much of their strength and earnings power from the value of their makes and models. The world’s top 15 automotive brands are worth a combined $256 billion, with Toyota alone valued at $53.6 billion, according to marketing consultant Interbrand. Since the dawn of driving, auto marques have pitched themselves with their mechanical prowess, from Volkswagen’s “Drivers Wanted” slogan to the “Have You Driven a Ford Lately?” tagline and Mazda’s catchy “Zoom, Zoom” campaign. Lately, though, carmakers have pushed built-in technology like Wi-Fi as a selling point. That approach pits them against tech giants Google and Apple Inc., which are accelerating their own research into self-driving cars. Promoting comfort When autonomous vehicles begin to hit the road in the next decade, it’s not yet clear that legacy auto brands will take top billing on the hood of those cars, said Mark Short, a global automotive and transportation leader of transaction advisory services for consultant Ernst & Young. “The biggest question on the table today: Is it going to be a Chevy powered by Apple or is it going to be an Apple vehicle or a Google vehicle?” Short said. Eventually, Ford Motor Co. and other carmakers hope to offer consumers access to all forms of mobility — driverless cars, robot taxis, trains, bikes and buses — from the touch of an app that would bear their brands. Initially, though, automakers will promote the comforts that make their self-driving cars stand out. GM President Dan Ammann points to how airlines differentiate themselves with their services and amenities. He cites Singapore Airlines Ltd., which advertises the showers, enclosed passenger compartments and lounges it offers to its first-class flyers. “It will be about connectivity, comfort and all of that,” Ammann said. Mobile office Connectivity in the car will grow to become a $750 billion business by 2030, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co. GM is counting on connecting with consumers with a deal with AT&T Inc. to offer Wi-Fi hot spots in cars which builds on the 12 million autos it’s already outfitted with internet connections. GM also developed a partnership with IBM Watson that can mine a car’s data and figure out a driver’s preferences and habits. Using artificial intelligence, a car’s interactive infotainment system will then be able to direct the driver to gas stations, restaurants and other products and services their driving and shopping patterns suggest they need, said Mark Lloyd, GM’s consumer online officer. Automakers are already showing concepts of how autonomous cars could be used as a mobile office or a comfy living room on wheels. Mercedes-Benz’s F 015 concept features four seats that face each other while the walls of the oval-shaped luxury cruiser are covered with six digital tablets that communicate with the outside world. The idea is to create an experience that could take the role of a short flight, said Michael Hafner, director of driver-assistance systems and active safety for Mercedes. “It’s how comfortable a passenger is and how nicely the car takes turns,” Hafner said. “There are things that we do with our cars and suspensions that make them more comfortable. That will be important, and it makes the difference with brands.” Two roads Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive officer of the Volvo Car Group, sees automotive brands heading down two roads in the coming age — sticking a company’s badge on the nose of robo-taxis as well as on self-driving cars that are privately owned. To that end, Volvo is supplying self-driving cars to Uber Technologies Inc. for a test that the ride-hailing service is running in Pittsburgh. GM and Toyota Motor Corp. also have vehicles in similar tests to get their brands in front of ride-sharing consumers. Volvo plans to take the model it puts in robo-taxi fleets and add features to make it a premium car that it would sell to affluent suburban families. The principal selling point would be a full auto-pilot system, a $10,000 option, that wouldn’t require the driver to take the wheel in an emergency, Samuelsson said. Such a car will be on the road in five years, he said. “To make a premium car even more premium, you would offer a full auto-pilot, not a supervised version, but really one where you can sit back and watch a movie,” Samuelsson said. “Nobody will buy an autopilot that you have to supervise.” Brand trust In the autonomous race, car marques have a key advantage: trust. Luxury and established brands are viewed more favorably by consumers than tech companies, in part because of the safety reputation automotive brands have built up over decades, according to a recent survey by the consultant PricewaterhouseCoopers. “When you have no control and you’re putting your life purely in the hands of a robot, you care even more about the credibility of that brand,” said Evan Hirsh, an adviser to auto executives at Strategy&, a unit of PwC. “I’m not sure how much confidence I would have in a Lenovo car.” Building a trust bridge to the future is an important element of brand-building that has already started. In the meantime, carmakers are trying to figure out what the self-driving car of tomorrow will look like. At GM, designers use cardboard and furniture to mock up future cabins that will keep consumers coming back for their cars. And they rest knowing they have time to figure it out before the robots take over, said chief designer Mike Simcoe. “People will still be driving for a long time,” Simcoe said.

If Apple is true to form, then 2017 will see the release of the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Typically, the "s" models are a tweak to the handsets that preceded them, with the exteriors remaining the same while there are improvements internally. However, a third 7s is rumored to be joining the line-up, and it isn't the iPhone "Ferrari." One of the new features introduced for the iPhone 7 Plus was dual rear-facing cameras. Both are 12 megapixels, with one being wide-angle and the other a telephoto camera. It means you can get 2x the optical zoom and 10x the digital zoom as well as an "all-new Portrait mode." The rumor, courtesy of Japanese website Macotakara and translated by 9to5Mac, suggests the new 5-inch iPhone will include these two cameras, but mounted vertically. By switching the cameras to a vertical configuration, Apple would be offering an iPhone that you use on its side, much like a digital camera for capturing photos and videos. Could this be Apple's push to replace lower-end digital cameras completely? If true, it's an unusual move. The iPhone 7 uses a 4.7-inch display and the 7 Plus uses a 5.5-inch panel. Introducing a 5-inch model sounds like it may confuse matters for consumers, especially if the 4.7-inch iPhone 7s only includes one camera. Another possibility is that Apple intends to replace the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 with a 5-inch iPhone 7s including the second camera. That would also allow the iPhone 7s Plus to use a larger display to differentiate it more from the 5-inch model. Related Apple iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 6s: Should You Upgrade? Apple iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 6s: Should You Upgrade? With the "s" refresh typically not changing much it is also possible Macotakara stumbled on to very early designs for the iPhone 8, which is thought to be encased in glass to allow for wireless charging. For a couple of generations now, most of the details about new iPhone models have leaked before the launch. However, I think we're still a little too far away from the next launch to take there rumors too seriously. I'm sure many iPhone fans would be happy if Apple moved to a 5-inch iPhone, though, especially if it meant a bigger battery.

Your favorite stories ran the gamut, from an amazing yarn about how and why WhatsApp brought encryption to one billion people to the definitive review of the Google Pixel. And a whole lot of you were absolutely riveted by Dropbox’s exodus from Amazon’s butt. Before shutting out the lights and locking up for the holidays, we ran the numbers to determine the stories you, our beloved readers, liked most. Here they are, ranked in descending order. You might have missed some of them, so take a moment to pour yourself something nice and catch up. And thank you for reading. We couldn’t do this without you. 01 Forget Apple vs. the FBI: WhatsApp Just Turned on Encryption for A Billion People While most of the country was following Apple’s battle with the FBI over a federal order to unlock a terrorist’s iPhone, the biggest messaging service in the world quietly brought end-to-end encryption to every one of its 1 billion users.

I decided to build a PC; then make it work like a Mac. Ian Sherr Tech Culture by Ian Sherr 27 December 2016 12:00 am AEDT @iansherr Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them If you ask me what type of tech I have at home, you'd think I live in an Apple Store. We have iPhones, iPods, iPads, Apple TVs and Mac laptops. There isn't a PC in sight. I'm well-known for pushing my family to switch to Apple, too. No, it's not a cult thing. I'm just lazy. Did you know how much easier it is to fix these things? IBM says PCs cost about three times more than Macs to keep in good running order. And it's true. Just ask my in-laws how much less time I spend fixing computers when I visit, now that they've junked their old Windows-based PCs. My older brother, who convinced me to buy my first Apple computer (a PowerBook in 2003), often tells people he picks Macs because he doesn't have to routinely fight with them to work. But that changed for me in October. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, got on stage at the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters to announce new Mac computers. Namely, the new MacBook Pro laptop, redesigned with, among other things, a nifty touchscreen built into the keyboard. I had my wallet out and waiting, but it wasn't for that. I needed a new desktop. I sat and watched the event along with my infant son, hoping Apple's Mac Mini computer would be updated with faster chips. I wanted a new Mac Mini because it's about the size of two best-seller books stacked next to each other -- easy to stash right beside our TV. It also starts at only $499 (you have to supply the monitor, keyboard and mouse, which I already have). The problem is Apple hasn't updated the Mac Mini since October 2014. For the past several years, I've used a nearly 7-year-old MacBook Pro as a media center, storing all our family photos, videos, iTunes movies, music and everything else. I've also started using Plex, an app that allows me to stream and search for all that stuff the same way you use Netflix, but also for -- y'know -- pictures of my son's first smile. This year, it was time for a replacement. Sadly, MacBook Pro laptops were all that'd be on tap. Even Apple's iMac (last updated October 2015) and Mac Pro (last updated December 2013) desktop computers were neglected. If I bought a Mac Mini today, I'd be paying full price for a machine more than two years old. Apple, you let me down. My son's first Apple event ended in disappointment. Photo by Ian Sherr/CNET Cook may have told employees Apple is still committed to making desktop computers, but that's not much consolation for people like me looking to buy a new machine this year. I can't just go and buy a PC, though. I rely on Apple's well-regarded MacOS software around my home. I've purchased far too many apps made for Macs, too. But Apple's software runs only on computers it sells, right? Wrong. There's an option known as Hackintosh. It's a process of getting MacOS to run on PCs, and it's possible thanks to a group of way-nerdier-than-I-am people who are always finding new ways to make it work. It's worth noting this is not something Apple supports, and may be a violation of the MacOS licensing terms. But it promised to be an interesting experience, and I was sure to learn a bit more about my computer as I went through it. Enlarge Image This sucker hasn't been upgraded in years. Photo by Sarah Tew / CNET After several hours of research, I decided to build a machine of my own. I went into this eyes wide open, prepared for the time, effort and hours of squinting at a screen this would take. I'd also have to learn how to manage driver software, the tech that makes stuff like video and audio work with an app. When you buy a Mac, Apple does all that for you. It just works. That's part of the appeal. On other computers, you have to keep CDs around and websites bookmarked just in case you need to reinstall a driver or update to make things work. Since my Hackintosh wasn't sanctioned by Apple, I'd have to figure all that stuff out now, too. Let me just say now that I'm not an engineer. My college degrees are in history and journalism. Building my Hackintosh It's relatively easy to get started on putting together a Hackintosh. There are many step-by-step guides and websites devoted to cataloging all the parts the community has found work with MacOS. This is important: Not all computer parts on store shelves offer the right software. One of the people who helps build these meticulous lists is Tonymacx86, whose website consistently draws several hundred thousand active members and as many as 10 million page views per month (and potentially more around the time of Apple events or MacOS updates). Though a trusted guide to many, Tonymacx86 prefers to stay anonymous to avoid overzealous fans and detractors alike. It used to be a lot harder to build a Hackintosh, but thanks to special software made by the community, even moderately computer-savvy people can do it. What's changed is that over the years, Apple and its parts suppliers have offered more code that Hackintosh builders can use to make audio, video and other components work. Still, the community relies on a dedicated team from around the globe to contribute new code and apps to help make setting up and maintaining a Hackintosh as easy as possible. "Our intention with the site's tools and guides was to lower the bar a bit and try to come up with a tried-and-true methodology for both new users and people who are tech-savvy," Tonymacx86 said. Let me just say now that I'm not an engineer. I ended up spending about $800 on all the pieces to build a machine, based on Tonymacx86's recommendations. I figured it should last me for the next six or seven years. Oh, and did I mention it'll be upgradable? Once everything from the microprocessing brain to the hard drive to the case arrived in the mail, I spent two days assembling my new computer. Imagine putting together an intricate Lego set, only this is a computer with screws, sharp edges, electricity and expensive parts you can inadvertently break if you touch them the wrong way. Enlarge Image Look inside my Hackintosh and you see a lot of cords and fans. It's not as sleek as a typical Mac. Photo by Ian Sherr/CNET Looking at my new machine, one downside was glaring. That svelte design Apple's known for? Gone. The black box I have now is 8.2 inches high and stretches 15.7 inches long, which is small by build-your-own-PC standards. But it seems ginormous compared to the Mac Mini's 1.4 inches by 7.7 inches. It even takes up more room than the Mac Pro's 9.9 inch height and 6.6 inch diameter. When my wife first looked at the machine, she gave me the side-eye, "Where's it gonna go?" In a one-bedroom apartment filled with books and baby gear, that's a fair question. Turning on my Hackintosh What I didn't expect was that even with parts the Hackintosh community said would work with MacOS, it still took hours to get my new machine up and running. I had to reach deep into the code of the computer and learn how the software makes video appear on the screen and how it moves audio to a speaker. I had to learn about software that makes USB thumb-drives work. It was kind of a nightmare. At one point, I cursed my days-earlier self for being too ambitious, too foolhardy and too naive to think this would mostly just work. Batteries Not Included The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech is cool. In the end, it took about 50 hours to get everything working, and another few to load all those apps I couldn't live without back onto the computer. There are still some odds and ends that make this less-than-ideal: My Hackintosh works better using the year-old MacOS version 10.11 El Capitan. That means I don't get the new features that came out this year in MacOS 10.12 Sierra, like the Siri voice assistant or better connections with my iPads and iPhones. But I can live without all that. It's good that Apple offers software updates for free, but Tonymacx86 said Apple could help the community further if it offered its code to the public, a practice known as open-source. Apple does publish some of its code, but not all. Imagine putting together an intricate Lego set, only this is a computer with expensive parts you can break if you touch them the wrong way. And remember, Apple makes its money by selling the computers I shunned. So, the company's not exactly inclined to help. An Apple spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. One thing that'll bug me is that I'll have to be much more careful treading around MacOS these days. I can't just automatically download and install the latest upgrade, or even a regular security update. I have to check first with the Hackintosh community to see if it'll upset the various programs they created to make all this stuff work. As to where I physically store my new computer, we're still figuring that out. But that's not the point! What really matters is that I beat Apple. I won. I think.

By Rishabh Jain On 12/27/16 AT 6:29 AM Close Apple might come out with a 5-inch iPhone sporting iSight dual-cameras in 2017, similar the ones on its iPhone 7 Plus which was launched this year. But there is a slight twist — instead of the usual horizontal placing of dual cameras, Apple might place them vertically on the new iPhone, Japanese tech site Macotakara reported Tuesday. According to the report, iPhone 8 (it may also be called iPhone 7s) will mark a change in iPhone and iPhone Plus series’ display sizes. Apple's next smartphone might have 5-inch and 5.8-inch displays instead of the 4.7-inch and 6-inch ones on the current models. Related Stories What To Expect From Apple In 2017 Apple May Catch Up To Samsung With Use Of OLED Displays The next iPhone is expected to release in the second quarter of 2017. These are not the only rumors that have surfaced about the upcoming smartphone. The device is expected to have an OLED display variant with sensors and fingerprint sensor embedded in the display. The company is expected to get rid of its home button and go for a glass design, which supports wireless charging. An A11 processor under the hood based on the 10-nm processor technology, iris/facial scanning and a multi-sensor camera are some other rumors that have surfaced about the smartphone.

December 27, 2016 Jeff Rum In 2005, Steve Jobs gave a moving speech to the graduating class of Stanford University about “connecting the dots.” “You can’t connect the dots looking forward,” Jobs told students. “You can only connect them looking backward.” It seems that no one has perfected the crystal ball. Of course, this doesn’t stop us from trying. The beginning of each new year beckons and so, from our limited vantage point, we try to see the future. This has become something of a tradition online, as well: People consider history, and then they try to connect the next dot. Nonprofit and purpose-driven work requires that people be optimistic about the future, even if they can’t predict it. A few years ago, the Stanford Social Innovation Review published the predictions of a sociology professor, who wrote about what nonprofits might look like in 2025. Such organizations, the professor wrote, are uniquely dynamic: They are situated to promote engagement and advocacy, flexible enough to address emerging problems, and capable of partnering with numerous institutions. In all likelihood, they will do some version of all of the above. What will that look like? We’ll know in another eight years. Change is inevitable as tomorrow. Rather than predict the future, we've taken some time to look ahead and consider how best to prepare for the next year. 1. Find your storytelling strategy Everyone, it seems, wants to be an author. We won’t weigh into the complicated debates that pit Instagram Stories against Snapchat (though Social Media Today has a handy infographic comparing the two). However, innovations at those companies and countless others underscore a point that many have made for years: People crave narrative. They want context, introductions and explanations; they want to move from Point A to Point B. “Storytelling will become one of the most important marketing tools for us in 2017 because it provides a way to connect with the emotions that help drive donor engagement and ongoing support,” writes the founder of the nonprofit Open to Hope Foundation. “Our audience is then able to feel how they are assisting those that come to our nonprofit for help and that then drives them to continue providing financial support and time.” Learning to tell your story is a critical way to show your audience (and potential supporters) how you steward their support. It encourages transparency and accountability, and helps people to feel part of the change your organization hopes to make. Storytelling may become one of the most important marketing tools next year, but it is also true that telling stories has always been important. If you haven’t tried your hand at narrative strategy, 2017 may be your year to do so. 2. Connect with the donation revolution Last month, Apple announced that its Apple Pay system may now be used to support a number of prominent nonprofit organizations, from the American Red Cross to the Nature Conservancy to UNICEF. Others, like the American Cancer Society and PBS, plan to work with Apple Pay as well. Apple Pay’s vice president said in a press release, “We think offering such a simple and secure way to support the incredible work nonprofits do will have a significant impact on the communities they serve.” Apple Pay’s announcement capped a big year for donor flexibility, one that also brought us direct donations through Facebook. Don’t expect gains in donor flexibility to stop there. “Twitter is working on $Cashtags. YouTube has donation cards. Snapchat has Snapcash,” according to Nonprofit Tech for Good. “Money and online giving as we’ve known it is on the precipice of radical change.” That radical change should benefit nonprofits and purpose-driven organizations in the years ahead. It doesn’t take a crystal ball, then, to prepare. Apple Pay and Facebook both provide information on how to connect your organization to their online donations systems. And their posts are a good reminder of another tip for 2017: Read the development blogs and pressrooms of your social media platforms, search engines and browsers. They’re filled with tips and opportunities to improve your engagement with your audience. 3. Know your network “Even a regional nonprofit is competing with everyone who has an Internet presence,” writes Pamela Barden for NonProfit Pro. “Google 'donate feed hungry people' and you’ll get 1.65 million results; other than two paid advertisements, none on the first page of results were for my local area.” Distinguishing your good work means more than adding the name of your city to your profile or focusing your efforts on a specific local cause. Nonprofits and purpose-driven organizations need to tailor everything - social presence, narrative, mission and message, how they read metrics and what they take from them - to the network they hope to reach. In all likelihood, you’ve had your audience in mind for years before you launch your organization and start to share your mission. But, every day, you’re tasked with evaluating how effectively you reach your network, and how you can improve that reach. Should you be more responsive? Should you tell more stories through different media, like video? Should you collaborate with nonprofits in your region to have a greater impact, or should you expand your organization to address a greater need? “Measuring objective data about your nonprofit’s effectiveness - and translating that information to stakeholders - will continue to be emphasized going forward,” writes Carolyn Mappleton. Her wisdom is couched as a prediction; however, her advice is tried and true. How you translate your work and its success is determined, in part, by how well you know your network. If you know the people who support and benefit from your work, you can tailor your efforts to better meet their needs. That makes for a network that can thrive on transparency and mutual understanding, which encourages steady support. Rather than competing with the million-plus websites who do work like yours, focus on how specific your work can be, and how you can meet a specific need. It’s an integral part of a digital strategy and, going forward, that sort of work will be timeless. This post originally appeared on the Ignite blog.

This 5-inch iPhone model is said to be placed between the standard 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models that Apple launches every year, expected to be called the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus next year. According to a report by Japanese blog Macotakara, the 5-inch iPhone will have the dual cameras on the back aligned vertically instead of horizontally, as is the case with iPhone 7 Plus. However, the inclusion of this iPhone model is not a certainty as of now, and Apple will make the final decision by March 2017. (Also see: Apple iPhone 8 Leaks and Rumours So Far)It is possible that the 5-inch iPhone model is just one of the more than 10 iPhone 8 prototypes that Apple is reportedly working on. 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the launch of the original iPhone, which revolutionised the mobile phone industry, so it is widely expected that Apple will introduce next year an iPhone that ups the game once again. In fact, many outlets have said that Apple will release three versions of the 2017 iPhone – one is said to be the premium iPhone 8 model that will feature an overhauled design and a host of new features, while the remaining two will be the successors of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and sport relatively few upgrades. Among the rumoured changes of the iPhone 8 are the death of the Home Button, and a curved bezel-less design with an OLED display. It is said that Apple is doing away with the hardware Home button, and integrating its functions within the pressure-sensitive touchscreen; the front camera is also said to be embedded in the touchscreen itself. Other key leaked features of the iPhone 8 include an all-glass body, wireless charging, and iris scanner. Reports have pegged the screen size of the iPhone anywhere between 5-inch and 5.8-inch. For now, it seems we will probably have to wait till September next year to find out whether the freshly-leaked 5-inch iPhone is the premium iPhone 8.

According to Apple’s Taiwanese suppliers, there will be a third iPhone in the iPhone 7s series for 2017. Which sort of implies that, next year’s iPhone won’t be the fabled iPhone 8 with its OLED screen. But wait, there’s more! This third member of the iPhone 7s family will sport a 5-inch screen, putting it in the middle of the 7s and the 7s Plus. And to top it all off, it will have a dual lens camera, but arranged vertically instead. Pardon us if we find the train of information bordering on the almost comical. Given how many “reliable sources” there are floating around, there’s still a good chance this one comes off as close to rubbish. That said, there is indeed an ongoing debate of whether the 2017 iPhone will be an incremental iPhone 7 or the mythical iPhone 8 that has everything but the kitchen sink. Even the idea of a “middle child” iPhone is a bit perplexing, though Apple was also rumored to have a “Pro” version of the iPhone 7, which, of course, never came to pass. This 5-inch version of the iPhone 7s will have the same features as the smaller iPhone 7s and the larger iPhone 7s Plus, all except in one vital aspect. It will have a dual camera system, like the 7s Plus. But since it has a smaller body, Apple had to re-arrange its innards and had to settle for putting the cameras in a strange vertical layout. As for the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus themselves, they won’t be that different from this year’s duo, except for a new 10 nm Apple A11 processor. And having a third member of the family. If based on Apple’s previous pattern, one could indeed conclude that the iPhone 7s would be “it” next year. But given Apple’s less than impressive financial numbers this years, as far as smartphones are concerned, it might decide to push for the more radical iPhone 8 instead.

The latest reports suggest even a bigger surprise as the Japanese site Macotakara claims that Apple is planning yet another iPhone model. Apple will launch a 5-inch iPhone model next year, according to the report. 5-inch iPhone 7S The report, cited by a Taiwanese supplier, claimed that the 5-inch iPhone with specifications identical to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be released. The new iPhone is dubbed iPhone 7S, which is an updated version of the iPhone 7. The device will reportedly feature a dual-camera setup similar to the Plus model. However, the cameras will be vertically aligned rather than horizontally like in the current iPhone 7 Plus. The 5-inch iPhone model will be technically the medium model in extension of the iPhone 2017 lineup, according to MacRumors. There are multiple reports that have stated that there will be three new iPhone models in 2017. Besides, there are two updated iPhone 7 models, a premium model with curved OLED display and a glass casing is expected.

The latest report corroborated an Nikkei report that stated back in October a new 5-inch iPhone would arrive in 2017. The report had said all three iPhones will have new glass-backed designs. This, however, is in contrast with the late rumors of only the premium model supporting a glass sandwich design. Also Read- Samsung Galaxy S8 Release Date, Rumors: Specs To Include 8GB RAM, UFS 2.1, Beast Mode iPhone 8 to Support 5.5-inch display? Apple is probably adding the 5-inch model with plans to differentiate all the models with display size variations. There will be two iPhone 7S and 7S Plus models that are rumored to be 4.7 and 5.0 inch sizes. The third variation will reportedly be a 5.5-inch, or the so-called premium iPhone 8 and feature the OLED display panel. Reports in the past have also indicated a 5.8-inch iPhone. It is possible Apple may ditch the 4.7-inch model for 5.0 inch iPhone. The three iPhone models would then come in 5.0, 5.5 and 5.8 inch sizes.

Six researchers from the company’s recently formed machine learning group published a paper that describes a novel method for simulated + unsupervised learning. The aim is to improve the quality of synthetic training images. The work is a sign of the company’s aspirations to become a more visible leader in the ever growing field of AI. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and the rest of the techstablishment have been steadily growing their machine learning research groups. With hundreds of publications each, these companies’ academic pursuits have been well documented, but Apple has been stubborn — keeping its magic all to itself. Things started to change earlier this month when Apple’s Director of AI Research, Russ Salakhutdinov, announced that the company would soon begin publishing research. The team’s first attempt is both timely and pragmatic. In recent times, synthetic images and videos have been used with greater frequency to train machine learning models. Rather than use cost and time intensive real-world imagery, generated images are less costly, readily available and customizable. The technique presents a lot of potential, but it’s risky because small imperfections in synthetic training material can have serious negative implications for a final product. Put another way, it’s hard to ensure generated images meet the same quality standards as real images. Apple is proposing to use Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs to improve the quality of these synthetic training images. GANs are not new, but Apple is making modifications to serve its purpose. At a high level, GANs work by taking advantage of the adversarial relationship between competing neural networks. In Apple’s case, a simulator generates synthetic images that are run through a refiner. These refined images are then sent to a discriminator that’s tasked with distinguishing real images from synthetic ones. From a game theory perspective, the networks are competing in a two-player minimax game. The goal in this type of game is to minimize the maximum possible loss. Apple SimGAN variation is trying to minimize both local adversarial loss and a self regulation term.  These terms simultaneously minimize the differences between synthetic and real images while minimizing the difference between synthetic and refined images to retain annotations. The idea here is that too much alteration can destroy the value of the unsupervised training set. If trees no-longer look like trees and the point of your model is to help self-driving cars recognize trees to avoid, you’ve failed. The researchers also made some fine-tuned modifications, like forcing the models to use the full history of refined images, not just those from the mini-batch, to ensure the adversarial network can identify all generated images as fake at any given time. You can read more about these alterations directly from Apple’s work, entitled Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training.          LATEST STORIES (8) Iraqi Chopper Striking ISIL Positions Near Tal Afar Saudi Arabia's Costly War on Yemen and Its Great Losses in 2016 Iraqi Special Forces Recapture Another Neighborhood in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Special Forces Evacuate Civilians from Danger Zone in Mosul Elite Iraqi Forces in Battle with ISIL Militants in Mosul Mosul Operations: ISIL Terrorists Scatter in Fear After Tough Offensive by Iraqi Popular Forces Over 32 Killed, 61 Wounded as Blast Hits Sadr City Area of Baghdad Iran Opens Line of Small Caliber Ammunition NIOC Approves Qualification of 29 Foreign Energy Firms for Int'l Tenders Eternal Condemnation: Marking the First Anniversary of Sheikh Nimr’s Execution by Riyadh Turkey Mourns Victims of Istanbul Nightclub Attack Official: Iran's Petchem Exports to Hit 20mln Tons by Yearend Fabulous Fireworks Across World Greet 2017 Iran Ups Steel Exports by 51 Percent in 8 Months Damascus: Militants in One More Town Joining Peace Agreement with Syrian Gov't Iraqi Chopper Striking ISIL Positions Near Tal Afar TEHRAN (FNA)- Iraqi choppers struck at ISIL gathering positions near Tal Afar, West of Mosul.

Rumoured to feature a curved screen December 20th 2016 14 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Ferrari has developed a reputation for luxury as one of the world’s most famous supercar manufacturers. Jasper HamilThe Sun APPLE is planning to release a luxurious “Ferrari” iPhone 8 model, industry watchers have claimed. The Sun reports the latest iRumours suggest the tech giant will unveil three versions of its next smartphone in 2017. One of these is rumoured to have been codenamed Ferrari, indicating that it will be a super-deluxe version which will have tech fans drooling. The rumour, which was reported on the Chinese tech blog cnBeta, is unconfirmed. But it adds to mounting speculation that Apple is planning something big for its next smartphone, which is expected to be unveiled on the 10th anniversary of the day the late, great Apple CEO Steve Jobs showed off the first iPhone. How much would you pay for a luxury version of the iPhone 8?Source:AFP The Ferrari model is expected to feature a large “AMOLED” screen, which is a thin, light and energy efficient type of smartphone display. Previous rumours suggest that the iPhone 8 will feature a stunning curved display built by Apple’s arch-enemy Samsung. However, other iGossips have suggested Apple is planning something VERY different and will unveil an iPhone that folds in half just like old fashioned flip phones. It is also expected to feature wireless charging, meaning the device will be juiced up by placing on top of a charger, rather than plugging it into the wall or a computer.

This is the first time in recent history where Apple is deciding to share information with the public. Now, a few week s later, Apple has just published its first research paper, focusing on the company’s research in the intelligent image recognition field. The piece, which is titled “Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training,” described a program that’s able to decipher and understand digital images in a more advanced setting. The company began doing some basic tasks in this field such as the facial recognition feature found in the Photos app in iOS 10. In the paper, Apple explains the upsides and downsides of using real images compared to “synthetic” or computer generated ones. For real images, annotations must be added and can be an “expensive and time-consuming task” that requires real humans to individually label objects in a picture. On the flip side, computer-generated images are much easier “because the annotations are automatically available.” However, using synthetic images could lead to worse results. This is because “synthetic data is often not realistic enough” and would lead to an end-user experience that would only be able to detect computer-generated photos. In this paper, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the goal is to improve the realism of synthetic images from a simulator using unlabeled real data. The improved realism enables the training of better machine learning models on large datasets without any data collection or human annotation effort. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: December 27, 2016 3:33 pm Apple has published its first paper on artificial intelligence and machine learning. (Source: Reuters) Apple has published its first paper in the field of artificial intelligence. First spotted by Forbes, the paper academic paper titled “Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training” was submitted for review in mid-November before it finally got published by the Cornell University Library on December 22. The paper was written by Apple researcher Ashish Shrivastava along with Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Josh Susskind, Wenda Wang and Russ Webb. The paper describes a technique that improves the training that can given to an algorithm to recognise images using computer-generated images as opposed to real world. According to the research, in machine learning, using computer generated images in training neutral networks is more efficient than real-world images, primarily because these picture are already labelled authenticated. “Synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions”, the paper says. The paper proposes that a solution to that problem what Apple researchers call “Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning”.  The Apple researchers use a custom version of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), through which  the realism of a simulated image is boosted. Also read: Apple’s machine learning system, and why it won’t sacrifice user privacy: Report Artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be the next big thing in technology. Microsoft, Google, IBM, Amazon and Facebook recently announced the creation of “Partnership on AI”. Called “Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society”, it will be primarily aimed at educating users about artificial technologies. While its peers in the tech industry Google and Microsoft have been betting on artificial intelligence, Apple hasn’t been vocal about the new emerging technology. But looks like Apple is working to improve the machine-leaning techniques for quite sometime. Apple has big plans to integrate all its devices through the Siri, which can be found on its iOS devices, MacOS, Apple TV and watchOS.

Japanese site Macotakara, which has a good track on information on unreleased iPhones, claims that a Taiwanese supplier revealed Apple was planning on launching a 5-inch model featuring a vertical dual-camera system, as compared to the horizontal one that’s available right now on the iPhone 7 Plus. No other changes would be made on this model, the source claims, and all the other specifications would be identical to the rest of the iPhones, which means that Apple’s main purpose is just to offer a new size with the vertical dual-camera system. Why a 5-inch iPhone? The big question is why would the company plan on doing that? First and foremost, the vertical design could be adopted because of the 5-inch screen, as Apple could have more space under the hood horizontally than vertically. This feature is exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus right now, so if Apple brings it on a smaller iPhone, it might have to rethink the internal structure in order to fit in the camera module. More recently, there were rumors claiming that Apple was planning a third iPhone size that would come with a 5.7- or 5.8-inch display featuring OLED technology, so there are big chances that the company is internally considering several prototypes and this is how all these rumors reach the web. As for an iPhone with a 5-inch display, Apple might be trying to provide potential customers with a choice between the existing 4.7- and 5.5-inch options. At this point, Apple doesn’t have such an option and many 5-inch phone buyers are more tempted to go for Android, where the range of phones includes several models with this size. We’ll find out how much of this new report is true in the fall of next year, as the 2017 iPhone should launch in September as per Apple’s typical release cycle. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 8#5-inch iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Russia, Turkey Trying to Hack into iPhone Used by Ambassador’s Killer Pokemon GO Now Available on the Apple Watch iPhone 7 Plus Cameras Turn Black and Stop Working, Users Complain Top 2017 iPhone Codenamed “Ferrari,” Featuring OLED and New Internal Design New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Apple might be planning a 5-inch iPhone for 2017 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Designed by Apple, Built by Robots: iPhone Maker Gets Rid of Human Workers more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

For those who came in late, Nokia sued Apple after the outfit decided not to pay out for 32 licences on its tech  in Europe and the U.S. courts.  The Patents that Nokia claims Apple infringed, cover technologies such as display, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets and video coding. Nokia said Apple agreed to license a few of Nokia Technologies’ patents in 2011, but has declined offers by Nokia since then to license other patents whose inventions have been used in Apple mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPad, and the Mac. Now Apple is fighting back by refusing to sell Nokia’s Withings products.  Nokia bought Withings, which makes Wi-Fi scales and other digital health and fitness gear. A Google search finds a listing on Apple’s web store for both a bathroom scale and smart thermometer made by Withings, but clicking on the link leads to an error message on Apple’s site.   Tags: apple, nokia Search for: Recent Articles Don't look at that email when you wake up Checking your email on your smartphone after you wake up is a bad way to start the day, according to[...] 2016 a bad year for tech celebs too While the world moaned about the surprise exit of so many celebs in 2016 it was a pretty rubbish yea[...] Germany thinking of fining Facebook for each fake news story The German government is thinking of slapping a huge fine on Facebook for each fake news story it pu[...] Lumia has gone the way of the Dodo It is starting to look like the end is near for Microsoft's Lumia handsets and it is about to go the[...] Consumer Reports will not bow to Apple pressure The nonprofit outfit Consumer Reports is standing by its damning verdict on the MacBook Pro and is r[...] © 2017 TechEye.

Published: 10:29 December 27, 2016 AP   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE The popular mobile game Pokemon Go is now available on the Apple Watch, squashing rumours that the game’s maker was scrapping such plans. The game involves catching digital pocket monsters in an augmented-reality version of your surroundings. The Apple Watch version will let you discover nearby Pokemon and collect special items, such as potions, from nearby PokeStops. But once you encounter a Pokemon, you will need to use your iPhone to catch it. Still, the Apple Watch should make it easier for players to log their steps (needed to advance in the game and to hatch new Pokemon out of eggs), and to avoid walking around with their phones held out to search for nearby monsters. Pokemon Go was a huge success when it came out in July. It’s not clear how the Apple Watch version will do, especially now that it’s too cold in much of the Northern Hemisphere to be outside catching Pokemon. Plans for the watch version had been announced at Apple’s iPhone launch event in September. The game’s maker, Niantic, hasn’t announced any plans for Android Wear and Samsung Gear smartwatches.

Written by Anuj Bhatia | Updated: December 27, 2016 2:03 pm Here are the biggest tech disappointments of 2016. The year 2016 was a big one for consumer technology all around, but it wasn’t always good news. The demise of the Galaxy Note 7 is a story unlikely to be forgotten for sometime, then there was Yahoo’s massive data breach with over a billion accounts compromised. Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter came under scathing criticism for not cracking the whip on fake news, BlackBerry announced it won’t be manufacturing its own phones anymore. Here’s a look at the biggest technology disappointments of 2016. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 It was hailed as the best smartphone, and also the contender to the iPhone 7 Plus. The reviews called it the best Android phone, but that didn’t last. Samsung’s much loved Galaxy Note 7 was prone to heating up and catching fire, resulting in multiple injuries for consumers across the world. Samsung had to recall the Galaxy Note 7 not once, but twice, and finally the company pulled the plug on the product and announced it was ending production for the same. The company estimates a loss of close of $5 billion thanks to the end of Note 7 phone. More so, Samsung still has no clear answer on what caused the Galaxy Note 7’s battery to malfunction. Also read: The death of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Smartwatches and their demise It was a terrible year for smartwatches, as even market leader Apple struggled and saw sales dip. Besides Apple, Google’s Android Wear saw no new big launches, and it was reported that Lenovo won’t be introducing a new version of the Moto 360 anytime soon. Fitbit announced it was acquiring Pebble and the Pebble watches will no longer be manufactured. The year also saw the demise of Pebble, the kickstarter project that started a smartwatch following among early adopters and loyalists. In December 2016, Fitbit announced it was acquiring Pebble and that Pebble watches will no longer be manufactured. Also read: Pebble smartwatches are now dead: For an early adopter, this is sad news Yahoo data breach Yahoo’s massive data breach was one of the worst and biggest ever. In September, Yahoo announced that over 500 million user accounts were compromised and hacked advising users to change passwords. Worryingly the hacking took place in 2014, and it took Yahoo two years to alert users of the same. Yahoo’s massive data breach was one of the worst and biggest ever. Then in December, it was revealed that more than 1 billion Yahoo accounts were hacked, and this took place in 2013. The stolen data included names, email addresses, date of birth, telephone numbers and encrypted passwords; in fact hackers even had managed to get access to Yahoo’s proprietary ‘Cookie’ technology, which allowed them to access accounts even without a password. For Yahoo, 2016 was perhaps one of the worst years ever, and it will be tough for the company to regain consumer trust. BlackBerry gives up on hardware BlackBerry finally announced it would halt in-house production of smartphones, marking the end of an era for the Canadian technology firm. BlackBerry will depend on partners to manufacture the phones and instead will focus on software, security and management; it is relying on TCL to make and distribute its phones in the future. BlackBerry once dominated the smartphone market, but its position was challenged by Apple with the iPhone. BlackBerry once dominated the smartphone market, but its position was first challenged when Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, and later Google’s Android emerged as the big winner. BlackBerry recently released two smartphones, the DTEK50 and DTEK60 in the market, which are manufactured by TCL. Also read: BlackBerry to stop making its own signature phones  Fake news In this mobile-first world, social media has emerged as the top source for consuming news. Facebook and Twitter are growing as news sources for many of us, but 2016 highlighted the exact problems with this trend. Facebook in particular, has come under heavy criticism for its failure to spreading fake news during the US elections. Stories claiming that the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump or how an FBI officer investigating Clinton’s emails had died were shared widely on Facebook, even though they were fake. Twitter too came under criticism for failing to curb false information from spreading quickly. For instance, messages about how pro-Hillary voters could do so via text were shared on Twitter, which was misleading. Facebook in particular, has come under heavy criticism for its failure to spreading fake news While Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was initially reluctant to admit that the spread of fake news on the social network was to blame for the election outcome, he later announced a slew of measures to tackle this problem.

But, somehow we aren’t still convinced with modular smartphones, especially when it comes to their implementation. LG G5’s biggest selling point over the Galaxy S7 was its modular nature; you could snap off its bottom piece of the LG phone to swap the battery, or replace it with a camera module or a Hi-Fi audio module. However, the company’s approach was half-baked and it didn’t win any rave reviews. Plus these attachments (or “Friends as LG likes to call) were sold at high prices and mostly unavailable for purchase. LG’s approach was half-baked and it didn’t win any rave reviews. Google also announced it had dropped plans for a modular smartphone with interchangeable parts. The death of Project Ara was seen as a big blow to the modular smartphone dream. For now, modular phones have not really emerged as a convincing alternative. Also, there is no set standard in place to make a hardware ecosystem for modular smartphones. Google had a chance to do so, but it missed out. For now, the perfect modular smartphone is still missing.

Its monthly active users remain at around 330 million and the social media platform has not seen the rapid growth that it had once hoped to achieve. Instagram has already surpassed Twitter in terms of both monthly active user base, and the daily active users. There were also reports that Twitter was up for sale, with Salesforce being among the top contenders. Others potential buyers included Microsoft, Alphabet and the Walt Disney Company. It remains to be seen if 2017 will prove to be a better year for Twitter. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: BlackBerry Facebook Samsung Twitter Yahoo Yearender 2016 Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

Now, just a few weeks later, the first of these papers has been made public on the preprint server arXiv. The paper — titled "Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training"— deals with intelligent image recognition technology. Specifically, it describes a technique that would enable a program to recognize and decipher computer-generated images. So far, this has not been possible because, as the researchers from Apple note, “synthetic data is often not realistic enough,” and increasing the realism is “computationally expensive.” Related Stories Nokia Sues Apple For Allegedly Infringing Nokia Products Microsoft Using Machine Learning To Detect Blindness “With recent progress in graphics, it has become more tractable to train models on synthetic images, potentially avoiding the need for expensive annotations. However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions,” the researchers wrote. “In this paper, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the goal is to improve the realism of synthetic images from a simulator using unlabeled real data.” In order to do so, the researchers used a technique known as adversarial learning, wherein two competing neural networks basically try to outsmart each other. In this case, the two neural networks are the generator, which, as the name suggests, generates realistic images, and the discriminator, whose function is to distinguish between generated and real images. “We develop a method for S+U learning, which we term SimGAN, that refines synthetic images from a simulator using a neural network which we call the ‘refiner network,’” the researchers wrote in the study. “To add realism – the first requirement of an S+U learning algorithm – we train our refiner network using an adversarial loss.” The paper is likely to be the first of many to be authored and published by Apple’s machine learning researchers in the coming weeks and months, now that the tech giant has lifted its restrictions on sharing research. Reports suggest that this decision was taken primarily to recover the ground Apple has lost in recent years to the likes of Google, Microsoft, Facebook and the Elon Musk-backed startup OpenAI, insofar as AI-related research is concerned.

But, a little over a month, researchers at the company have published their first AI paper, titled “Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training” which focuses on the company’s work in the field of intelligent image recognition. According to the research paper, Apple notes that with recent progress in graphics, it has become more tractable to train models on synthetic images, which potentially also avoids the need for expensive annotations. However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. To reduce this gap, Apple proposed Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning. With this proposal, Apple believes that the task would simply be to learn about a model, to improve the realism of a simulator’s output using unlabeled real data. Forbes explained that researchers are using a modified version, of a new machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks, which pits two neural networks against each other and has been used to generate photorealistic images. Apple’s first public research paper has been published by a team of six researchers namely, Ashish Shrivastava, Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Josh Susskind, Wenda Wang and Russ Webb.

Advertisement Most parents will share an iPad with a child or teen, and now it is even more likely that your kid has their own iPad to play games, read books, do homework and other activities including browsing the internet and engaging on social media.   There are two concerns when giving a small child or even an older kid your iPad: protecting the device from them and protecting them from what’s on the device. This and other hard core cases can take care of the former, but you’ll need to set up some parental controls to take care of the latter. Learn how to set up parental controls on the iPad. Advertisement Apple delivers some restrictions that let you turn off some apps, stop kids from downloading and buying new apps or in app purchases and there is even a way to hide apps. With recent updates Apple now offers a built in website filter to help keep adult content off the iPad without the need to buy software or change settings on your router. Advertisement If you share an iPad with your child you will need to turn these restrictions on and off each time you switch between using the iPad yourself and the child using your iPad. If they have their own iPad you can set this up once and be done with it. Once you disable restrictions, you’ll have to go through and enable each one again the next time — completely tedious. There are several kid-safe tablets that offer better parental controls that you can set and forget. But if you’re sticking with the iPad, here’s how to set them up. (Related: 5 Kid-Friendly iPad Alternatives For Kids) Advertisement Turn On The iPad’s Restrictions Set up iPad parental controls.   Go to Settings > General > Restrictions and tap Enable Restrictions. Every time you do this you’ll be asked to set a 4-digit passcode and enter it a second time. Be sure it’s something you can remember but your kid won’t figure out. Avoid your birthday, their birthday and simple series of numbers. Setting App-Based Restrictions This is where you can control what apps the child can use on the iPad. Toggle the setting off to stop them from connecting to the Internet, using the camera, buying new apps or downloading new apps. Advertisement You can control access to many apps, but not all with iPad parental controls. On this section you can also turn off the option to make in-app purchases. This allows you to control spending in games that encourage this behavior. If you scroll down further you will see options to set ratings for content that allows you to filter by ratings for Music, Podcasts, Movies, TV Shows, Books, Apps Siri and more. Apple assigns ratings, but for movies the ratings are those assigned by the MPAA like you see in a theater. Keep in mind that your own ideas of a rating may not always match those assigned by Apple or others. Advertisement Scrolling down further you can make changes to how kids interact with Game Center and the information that is shared under a Privacy settings and even lock down account changes or set a volume limit.     Setting Up Web Content Filtering Any iPad running iOS 7 or newer includes an option to set up iPad web content filtering right out of the box. This is also in Restrictions and it does a good job of limiting what your child can see but like all automated solutions it is not perfect. Go to Settings > General > Restrictions and tap Enable Restrictions if you’ve already left that area. Scroll to Allowed Content and tap on Websites. On this page you can choose if you want to allow access to all websites or limit access. If you choose Limit Adult Content the iPad will not be able to access adult websites, but keep in mind this may limit access to some sites a child needs access to for school and it may not block every site you don’t want your kid to access. If you need a more limited set of rules you can set the iPad to only allow access to specific websites. There is no reporting option to tell you what websites the iPad attempted to visit.   Keeping Kids Out Of Your Email Apple does not let you keep kids out of your email, calendar or iMessages, but you can at least prevent them from making changes to the account. One solution is to use an app like Gmail and then sign out every time you hand your iPad over, but this is quite a hassle. Until Apple adds support for multiple users it will continue to be a pain.   Setting Media-Based Restrictions Kids will want to watch video, especially when they’re traveling. You can keep iTunes available but disable the inappropriate movies, TV shows and music. Under Allowed Content you can set the ratings level for movies based on MPAA ratings and TV shows based on US content ratings. Unfortunately you can only disable explicit music and podcasts and not a wider range than that or all music. Setting Location-Based Restrictions There are few good reasons for kids to broadcast their location to an app or to friends from the iPad, so it’s a good idea to turn off location services. Under Allow changes tap Location. The apps you see on this screen may differ from mine. Switch them all to Off, then flip Location Services to Off as well. Once you do, then choose Don’t Allow Changes to lock these down. However, if you’re worried that your child will leave the iPad somewhere and forget it or simply lose it, leave Find My iPad on as well as Location Services. 26 Responses 03/26/2012 marty9999 Reply  Another very good Parental Control Browser is McGruff SafeGuard Child Safe Browser for the iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch.

I organise my apps by screen and in folders. I applied restrictions to a number of apps, making them disappear from the screen. When I un-restricted the apps had they been returned, but none were in folders or in the same place. This means whenever i pass my ipad to my son i have to set up all the restrictions, and then re-organise all the apps positions. This is not an easy system to use. 10/20/2012 jffranca Reply but the more important that would be define a period of time ( in minutes or hours ) that my child could play with ipad … that Apple forgot… 11/03/2012 nomad Reply as usual, apple parental controls suck, best form of control is to simply not give your kid an ipad, iphone, etc. 11/05/2012 Manden6 Reply All of those controls are on the iMacs.

After all, it has Siri and some intelligent object recognition in its camera apps. The reason why you don’t hear much about it is that Apple has mostly been secretive about its AI R&D, which has been criticized by the AI community for years. That changed when, earlier this month, Apple promised to start publicly publishing its AI research, the first of which has just finally been revealed. The subject of Apple’s first ever public AI research paper revolves around one of the biggest problems in AI, at least next to natural language processing. That is image recognition, which is applied in fields like computer vision, facial recognition, augmented reality applications, and, well, chat bots. To be specific, the paper tackles the problem of how artificial intelligence agents are trained to recognize said images. There currently two methods in use, representing two extremes of learning methods. One might immediately presume that real world images should be used in teaching computers to recognize images. While that is definitely the ideal, it is also the hardest to get right. Easiest for AI is the use synthetic images, images that have already been prepared, labeled, and annotated for AI learning. The downside of this method is that, when faced with real-world images, the AI gets dumbfounded. Microsoft’s solution is somewhat the middle ground of the two, a modification of a Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U) learning method. It uses an adversarial tactic which, in a nutshell, trains one AI to improve the realism of a synthetic image to the point that another AI can no longer distinguish it from the real thing. Apple’s AI paper might not be groundbreaking, though will definitely be of interest to the AI community, but it represents a significant change in direction for the company. Whether Apple intends to keep that change and for how long remains to be seen and no AI yet exists that can predict that.

Previous report from Nikkei had suggested that Apple will release 5-inch iPhone and it will have a all glass back design. Last month, Barclays Research analysts claimed that the company will introduce two iPhones with 5-inch and 5.8-inch display. Next generation iPhones are already rumored to come with OLED display. 2017 iPhones are also expected to support Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) on both the camera modules. Earlier in March, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said that the next gen iPhone will come with curved panels on the front and back with metal on the sides and sport an AMOLED screen. Earlier this month Macotakara also said that next gen iPhone will come in a new bright red color variant. Last week, a tipster stated on Weibo that Apple could launch iPhone, iPhone Plus variant and a new high end ‘Ferrari’ model. We have already read a lot about possible improvements and new features on the upcoming iPhones next year. Apple is expected to bring major design changes to iPhones next year as it is will be company’s 10th anniversary.   Source | Via "Apple said to be working on 5-inch iPhone with vertical dual cameras", 5 out of 5 based on 13 ratings.

Q10 Who at Apple was know as the “Father of the iPod?” No peeking now... Christmas Quiz 2016 round 2: The answers Q1 Along with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who was the third founder of Apple in 1976? Ronald Wayne. The original partnership agreement signed on 1 April 1976 saw him, “Assume major responsibility for Mechanical Engineering and Documentation,” alongside roles for Jobs and Wozniak. Wayne received a 10 per cent stake in Apple but relinquished his stock, for $800 shortly after, concerned about his assets being seized if the company failed. His share was estimated to be worth $48.7 billion in 2012. Wayne expressed no regrets over the decision Q2 Which college did Apple’s Jonathan Ive attend? Born in Chingford, London, Ive studied industrial design at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University). “I saw his work as it was developing and my view of him was a quiet, thoughtful and hard-working student,” recalled Neil Smith, Northumbria University’s enterprise fellow from the School of Design. Q3 Apple CEO Tim Cook serves on the board of directors of which other high-profile company? Nike. Cook has served on the its board since November 2005. He’s also a member of the National Football Foundation’s board of directors. Q4 What happened to Steve Wozniak on 7 February 1981? Woz was involved in a plane crash. He crashed his new single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC, while attempting a take-off from Santa Cruz Sky Park. Woz and his three passengers, including then-fiancé Candice Clark, were all injured, with the Apple co-founder suffering from partial amnesia. The crash is cited as the reason why Woz took time off from Apple, returning to study at Berkeley. Q5 Which high-profile politician joined Apple’s board of directors in 2003? Al Gore, former vice president of the United States, joined Apple’s board in March 2003. “Al is an avid Mac user and does his own video editing in Final Cut Pro,” Steve Jobs noted at the time.  Q6 Name the design agency Jonathan Ive co-founded? Tangerine. Ive co-founded the London based design agency, where he developed power tools, wash basins, TVs, and more. Apple was a client, and Ive was eventually offered a job by the Mac maker. He said: “I still remember Apple describing this fantastic opportunity and being nervous that I would mess it all up.” Q7 When Apple launches a new product, where can Woz normally be found? In line, queuing outside an Apple Store with other customers. “The launch of a new Apple product is for me like a big, major concert in which you absolutely must attend personally,” he has said.  Q8 In 1983, from which company did Jobs poach John Sculley to become Apple CEO?  Pepsi-Cola, a division of PepsiCo. After a long business courtship, Jobs asked Sculley: “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?”  Q9 Who planned to quit Apple in 1997 over what he considered a desire for profit maximisation? Jonathan Ive. The designer had believed Apple had put profits before product design, until Jobs convinced him otherwise. “I remember very clearly Steve announcing that our goal is not just to make money but to make great products,” Ive said. Although Jobs looked around for other quality designers including Richard Sapper, who designed the IBM ThinkPad, Jobs and Ive went on to form a strong business and personal relationship.  Q10 Who at Apple was know as the “Father of the iPod?” Tony Fadell. He developed a music player that he pitched to Apple. That idea became the iPod. He headed the iPod division at Apple until 2008 at which point he left the company in order to raise his family, however, he stayed on as an advisor at Apple until 2010.

Nokia Corp had said on Wednesday it was suing Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of violating 32 technology patents. It said on Thursday it had now filed 40 patents suits in 11 countries. Nokia shares were down nearly 5 percent at 4.496 euros on Thursday as analysts warned a legal battle with Apple could hold up royalty payments that are vital to shoring up the Finnish company’s profits. Nokia’s patent licence contract with Apple expires at the end of the year. This week, both sides have taken legal action – with Nokia accusing Apple of violating some technology patents and Apple complaining of being overcharged – suggesting a new deal will be hard to agree. “Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today’s mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple’s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights”, ” Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Nokia patent business said in a statement. “Nokia will likely be granted a better licence deal from Apple. But because of the dispute, it could take years to reach a new contract, and royalties will likely come (as) retrospective one-time payments,” said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen, who has an “accumulate” rating on Nokia shares.

Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um, who follows both companies, said the lawsuits were negative for Apple and Nokia due to litigation costs and uncertainty over the outcome. “The fact that this did not go to arbitration suggests, to us, that the two sides must be far apart in what each party wants,” he wrote in a note to clients. “It appears (Apple) is not arguing the validity of the patents but, rather, the rate it deems fair,” he said, adding Nokia could also “choose to file a suit with the International Trade Commission (ITC) to bar Apple from importing handsets into the U.S.” Um rates both companies’ shares as “market perform”.

The Finnish firm has forecast the run-rate of its patent and brand licensing sales will be about 950 million euros ($994 million) by the end of 2016, but that it will fall to about 800 million after the Apple deal expires, in the absence of a new one. Nokia’s total sales in 2016 are expected to top 24 billion euros.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: MEDIA Trent Reznor talks about the iPod, vinyl records, and his role at Apple Music Jordan Novet@jordannovet December 22, 2016 10:44 PM Tags: Apple, Apple Music, Beats 1, ipod, Records, top-stories Above: Trent Reznor, left, and Atticus Ross on Apple Music in December 2016. Image Credit: Beats 1 Twitter account Industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails today started letting people buy their new EP, Not the Actual Events, through the band’s website, ahead of the five-song album’s release on music streaming services. To mark the release, frontman Trent Reznor and newly appointed fellow band member Atticus Ross went on Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio show for an interview with anchor Zane Lowe, before Lowe played the new recording in full. The conversation is wide-ranging and worth listening to for fans of the band. But it’s also fascinating for those who follow Apple. Reznor has contributed to Apple Music since its 2014 acquisition of Beats Music, and he is arguably one of the company’s most prominent assets in the music world. Yet Reznor didn’t give Apple an exclusive on the band’s new release. What Apple got instead is a big interview, which the company understandably hyped on social media. This arrangement stands out from Apple’s typical approach to music these days. As Apple Music executive Larry Jackson said in an interview with the New York Times, the release of exclusive music is “still consistently a very powerful messaging tool, just marketing for the concept of streaming.” Competing services, including Tidal, have also promoted exclusive releases, but at Apple Music, they have practically become a feature. Reznor, though, has never been one to fit in. In the interview, he talked about how he “resisted iPods” in their early days, even though he’s an Apple employee and was making an appearance on an Apple media platform. And even though Apple offers instant access to tens of millions of songs on Apple Music for a monthly fee, Reznor said he prefers to listen to vinyl records the whole way through. Reznor also discussed what he’s tried to do in his contribution to Apple Music. Here’s a transcript of Reznor’s relevant remarks: You know, I’ve always been intrigued by technology. I resisted iPods when they first came out. You know, I didn’t feel like that was how I wanted to listen to music at the time. A couple of lines of Chicago font, you know, with a white background. But taking one on tour and realizing that I’ve got several thousand albums at my disposal changed the way I listened to music. You know, now I could take all of Frank Zappa’s catalogue with me instead of those Case Logic CD boxes, you know, lugging them onto planes and buses. And seeing that stereos changed from what they were in my day to the computers in dorm rooms and realizing that physical media is dead, or will be dead. Okay, interesting, interesting. Watching what’s happening over the last few years with streaming services and clearly understanding that’s what’s going to happen, and access — everyone will have access to everything. Sadly watching the devaluation of music in the process. And I’m not saying that as a greedy musician but just — not just monetarily, but music is something now you do in the background, while you’re checking your email, while you’re distracted by the other barrage of stimulation coming out of your phone or whatever screen you’re in front of. I’ve tried my best with Apple to help elevate Apple Music into being something that retains some of the great qualities of walking into a cool independent music shop, you know, where you feel that music is respected and presented with love. And it’s not just an FTP server, you know. This record, we kind of feel like we’re offering it for sale, it’ll be on streaming services, it’s not exclusive anywhere. But if you want it from us, we’re selling it as a piece of vinyl that feels like something we want you to have. I enjoy having a — it’s an experiential thing, you know, you have to touch it, you have to figure out where to put it, you know, you see it when you walk past it. It exists in the physical world. And we have something that, if you buy it digitally from us, we’re also going to ship something to you. That’s the experience. I don’t expect any or many people to follow that path, but as the artist, that’s the premium experience to me. And I expect that to be eyerolled, and that’s totally fine, you know, but I’ve begun listening to a lot more vinyl lately, because I like not being able to skip songs. I like putting it on, and I like the idea that there’s a 20-minute suite of music, and then I have to get up and turn it over, and there’s another 20-minute suite of music. And if the phone rings, or something happens, it’s not as convenient as it just goes away. It’s something that, you know, I turned out the way I did, and the music I loved, the music that’s shaped who I am as an artist, is because I had to — I listened to it that way. I only had a few albums that I could afford, and frankly, I didn’t like some of them. You know, I didn’t like the Talking Heads’ Remain in Light when I got it. I couldn’t understand it. It scared me, you know? But I only had 30 albums, and that’s the one I invested in that month, and I listened to it. You know, and on the third listen, it started to make sense to me. You know, and on the 10th listen, I enjoyed it. You know, and on the 50th listen, it made me smarter, you know, and it changed my viewpoint. And I don’t think — when you have access to everything, that it’s so easy to say no, no, no, no, skip, skip, skip — you know, you live with that stuff. You know I’m not lamenting old technology. I’m just saying that the byproduct as I see it is the role of music as an important art form has suffered a bit. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

According to the report, Apple plans to introduce a 5-inch iPhone with the refresh next fall… The report, which cites an unnamed Taiwanese supplier, claims that the 5-inch iPhone will be identical in specifications to the “iPhone 7s” and “iPhone 7s Plus.” The 5-inch model will reportedly feature a dual-camera setup similar to that of the Plus model, but the cameras will be vertically designed rather than horizontally like the current iPhone 7 Plus. Given that the 5-inch model is said to be identical to the refreshed iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, it seems as if it’s more of an extension of the lineup rather than a radically different model or a replacement. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard of Apple introducing a 5-inch iPhone. Nikkei reported back in October that Apple would add a 5-inch iPhone model to its lineup and that the iPhone lineup would move to all-glass backs across the entire lineup. Though, we’ve also heard reports of a 5.8-inch model. Specific details regarding the “iPhone 7s” refresh are surprisingly unclear at this point. Though, if Apple follows suit with previous ‘s’ refreshes, then we expect primarily internal changes rather than a radical design refresh. It’s believed, however, that Apple is saving the big design changes for an entirely new iPhone 8 model. This device is said to feature an all-glass design, wireless charging, an OLED display, and much more. As you can see, there are still a lot of uncertainty surrounding what exactly Apple has in store for 2017 and the new iPhone lineup. With today’s report, however, it seems increasingly likely that a 5-inch model is at least something the Cupertino company is considering. As for specifics, we’ll likely hear more as we inch closer to release, but the final word will come when the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, iPhone 8, or whatever they end up being called, are unveiled. Would you be interested in a 5-inch iPhone with a dual-camera design? Let us know down in the comments.

By Gurmeet Singh Pandher Posted on December 27, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Apple’s iPhone 7 disappointed many but for upcoming 2017, the Cupertino giant is bringing big iPhone 8 updates in line with their smartphone’s 10th anniversary celebrations. With the new year almost here, the internet is churning out rumors, speculations and leaks on the upcoming device. The latest reports have it that Apple will launch a radical design iPhone 8 and two iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus for next year. While the enthusiasts are pretty much excited about the radical iPhone 8 launching next year, they will have a hard time grabbing the device. iPhone 8 in Limited Quantities Apple will manufacture the iPhone 8 in limited quantities if the latest set of speculations are to be believed. Apple’s revenues from iPhone has reduced drastically since last year. A lot of users have already adopted the smartphone. The Cupertino based tech giant seeks to make in the losses with a premium phone made available in limited quantities. Apple iPhone 8 Also Read- Apple iMac 2017 Specs, Updates: Why Next Year’s iMac Will Be Boring The company will order only a limited number of iPhone 8 in order to make their device more premium. The strategy is similar to what many manufacturers do in order to increase demand and fuel sales. In addition, it is stated that Apple’s all new 10nm chips are likely to be another cause of lower production of iPhone 8 units. TSMC has won the 10nm chip contract for iPhone 8 orders but the A11 processor is expected to be in short supply, reports BGR. It is set to make A11 processors that’ll follow the A10 Fusion and newer iPad Pro’s A10x chips.

The rate yields don’t look good so far. This will likely impact Apple iPhone 8 plans as in case of shortage the company will resort back to older chipsets. The premium designed iPhone 8 will, however, be put on hold only for a minimum number of customers. Plastic OLED Display The OLED display for iPhone 8 has long been reported. The latest set of leaks, however, reveal a plastic OLED display instead of the glass screens Apple used earlier. The earlier iPhone models used LCD panels with Gorilla glass protection on the top. However, Apple’s next gen iPhone 8 will have an OLED with edge-to-edge curved display, according to reports. Apple will also bump the display size to 5.8in but the overall device size will remain the same. This is due to the bezel less design that the company has planned for the iPhone 8. Apple supposedly will ditch the Home button and embed a new Touch ID fingerprint scanner into the display itself.

By Agamoni Ghosh December 27, 2016 05:11 GMT LinkedIn''s acquisition will be the prime driver for Microsoft, says analyst Michael MarkowskiREUTERS/Dado Ruvic Microsoft's $26.2bn (£21.3bn) acquisition of LinkedIn could make it the first company to reach a market value of $1tn surpassing that of Apple and Alphabet, according to an analyst. Apple has the highest market cap of $621bn as of 23 December followed by Alphabet at $557bn and Microsoft at $491bn. Michael Markowski, writing for Equities.com, now predicts the Redmond tech giant is on course to reach a market value of $1tn due to three main factors: The company's free cash flow yield is the highest among of all contenders that include Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook LinkedIn acquisition expands Microsoft's PE multiple Microsoft is in position to play a key role in new social investing industry (SIC) which is the key to drive crowdfunding to ubiquity Markowski says Microsoft will reach this goal by making LinkedIn a leader in social media and the emerging crowdfunding industry. In fact, he predicts that online crowdfunding will be the next technological revolution, on par with the creation of the internet, email, social media, smartphones and apps. The online equity crowdfunding will be to Microsoft what the smartphone app revolution was to companies like Uber, Airbnb and Snapchat that made them count among the most valuable private companies in the world. The report, however, does not say by when Microsoft will achieve this feat although he expects the social media industry to drive online equity crowdfunding by 2025. As for Microsoft's stock, it hit an all-time high in October and has continued to climb since then. Although the company's mobile division has not been shining, its cloud platform Azure and its Surface products have helped the company climb this year.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple fans may be aware of the fact that the new MacBook Pros have failed to earn Consumer Reports recommendation. This is mainly because of their battery life as lab tests have revealed issues in three different MacBook Pro models. All the three devices performed superb when it came to display quality and performance. However, in terms of battery life, the results were disappointing. According to Consumer Reports, three MacBook Pro models were tested, one a 13-inch model without Touch Bar, another with the Touch Bar and the third a 15-inch variant. The battery life of the models was found to be highly inconsistent from one trial to the next. This news could be very embarrassing for Apple as probably for the first time Apple MacBook Pro may not be the best devices in the market. The 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar w orked for 19.5 hours in the first trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. The one with the Touch Bar performed for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and only 3.75 hours in the third. The 15-inch laptop’s battery performance ranged from 18.5 hours down to 8 hours. The results are pretty disappointing more so as fans expected the refreshed models to improve on the battery life of the predecessor, writes Gizmodo Australia. A laptop’s battery life typically varies by about five per cent in tests. The dedicated GPU in MacBook Pros could be draining battery fast. Moreover, there is no way to drop the onboard GPU. Hence, Apple MacBooks may switch between dedicated GPU and integrated graphics. Jerry Beilinson, the Consumer Reports editor, has stated in the report that he would not recommend any of the three MacBook Pro models to consumers as they fail to meet the battery standards. Battery performance is a very important and deciding factor for laptop buyers.

According to a report by Forbes, the paper deals with the problem of teaching AI to identify objects using simulated images. Apple said the technique it uses is called Simulated+Unsupervised learning, where “the realism of a simulated image is boosted”. “The Apple researchers use a modified version of a new machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks, which pits two neural networks against each other and has been used to generate photorealistic images,” stated Forbes. The paper’s lead author is Apple researcher Ashish Shrivastava, who holds a PhD in computer vision.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About General 4K drone footage reveals that Apple’s Spaceship campus is nearing completion Yoni Heisler @edibleapple December 26th, 2016 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet As Apple preps to move into its new spaceship campus in 2017, progress on the company’s gargantuan new headquarters is coming along nicely. Thanks to Matthew Roberts, who just recently shot some jaw-dropping footage of Tesla’s Gigafactory, we now have some new 4K drone footage of Apple’s new campus to enjoy as well. With Apple planning to run its new building using 100% renewable energy, taking a close look at the solar panels on top of the structure is particularly interesting. Per the video, Roberts estimates that installation of solar panels is about 65% complete at this point. Don't Miss: A man waited 416 days to see what happened when his iPod stopwatch passed 9,999 hours Apple’s Spaceship campus was originally conceived by Steve Jobs in 2011 as a direct response to the incredible amount of growth Apple was experiencing at the time. Apple was initially hoping to finish the project by 2015 but the entire operation was beset by a variety of minor delays. One of the cooler design aspects of the building is that the exterior of the building will consist of 3,000 specially designed and engineered curved glass panels that, taken together, will measure in at about one mile in circumference. “There’s not a single straight piece of glass in this building,” Jobs said during a Cupertino City Council meeting a few years ago. “We’ve used our experience in building retail buildings all over the world. We know how to make the biggest pieces of glass for architectural use. And, we want to make the glass specifically for this building here. We can make it curve all the way around the building… It’s pretty cool.” Tags: Apple View Comments Trending 1 Gaming CNN uses screenshot from ‘Fallout 4’ to show how Russians hack things 2 Mobile This rumored Galaxy S8 feature would be like nothing you’ve ever seen on an iPhone 3 Security Hackers have a new way to steal your banking login using WhatsApp 4 Mobile Here’s what a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus looks like after 3 months without a case 5 Entertainment The 10 best new movies and TV shows coming to Netflix in January Picked For You This rumored Galaxy S8 feature would be like nothing you’ve ever seen on an iPhone By Zach Epstein January 2nd at 1:36 PM iOS 10.3 might introduce an intriguing new ‘Theatre mode’ By Yoni Heisler December 31st at 8:01 PM CNN uses screenshot from ‘Fallout 4’ to show how Russians hack things By Mike Wehner January 2nd at 2:07 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use

The new MacBook Pro 2016 updates include more than just differences in screen size. Advertisement Yes, picking the best new MacBook Pro for your needs will include the screen size, but there are some options only available on the more expensive 15-inch MacBook Pro 2016 like more powerful quad-core processors, better graphics and 2TB Storage. The screen size also dictates the portability of the 2016 MacBook Pro. Apple reduced the overall size of the 15-inch and 13-inch models, but there is still a decent size difference between the two. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air, which really ups the ease of taking this notebook with you. How the 2016 MacBook Pro 13-inch vs 15-inch models compare. While there are only two screen sizes, there are three specific MacBook Pro models to choose from if you want the newest models, but only two of them come with the Touch Bar and Touch ID. Here’s how the 2016 MacBook Pro 13 vs MacBook Pro 15 specs and features compare. 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Specs 13-inch MacBook Pro 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar & Touch ID 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar & Touch ID Display 13.3-inch Retina Display 13.3-inch Retina Display 15.4-inch Retina Display Resolution 2,560 x 1,600 2,560 x 1,600 2,880 x 1,800 Dimensions 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.59 inches 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.59 inches 13.75 x 9.48 x 0.61 inches Weight 3.02 pounds 3.02 pounds 4.02 pounds Keyboard Full Size, Backlit Full Size, Backlit with TouchBar & Touch ID Full Size, Backlit with TouchBar & Touch ID Storage 256GB/512GB/1TB 256GB/512GB/1TB 256GB/512GB/1TB,/2TB Processor 2.0GHz/2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor 2.9GHz/3.1GHz/3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor 2.6GHz, 2.7GHz, 2.9Ghz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor RAM 8GB/16GB 8GB/16GB 8GB/16GB Graphics Intel Iris 540 GPU Intel Iris 550 GPU AMD Radeon Pro 450 2GB/Radeon Pro 455 2GB, Radeon Pro 460 4GB Networking 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2 Webcam 720P FaceTime HD 720P FaceTime HD 720P FaceTime HD Ports 2 Thunderbolt 3 (USB C Ports), Headphone jack 4 Thunderbolt 3 (USB C Ports), Headphone Jack 4 Thunderbolt 3 (USB C Ports), Headphone Jack Battery Life Up to 10 Hours Up to 10 Hours Up to 10 Hours Price $1,499 and up $1,799 and up $2,399 and up Availability Order at Apple Now Pre-Order Now Pre-Order Now 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Screens You need to decide if you want a lighter and more portable 13-inch MacBook Pro or a more powerful 15-inch MacBook Pro with a larger screen. The smallest MacBook Pro includes a 13.3-inch screen and the larger offers a 15.4-inch display. The 13-inch MacBook delivers a 2,560 x 1,600 resolution while the 15-inch MacBook Pro offers a 2,880 x 1,800. You can change the resolution to fit more apps on-screen at once as well. These are the same resolutions as the 2015 models, but the screens aren’t the same as your old one. Both of the new models include a brighter screen with more colors. Advertisement Both of the new MacBook Pro sizes offer a brighter display, 25% more colors and a 67% higher contrast ratio than the older models. Thankfully all the new MacBook Pro models include this upgraded display so size and resolution are your main factors. We use the 1,440 x 900 resolution on the older 13-inch MacBook Pro to allow for more space to use apps on the smaller screen. You can change the resolution on both to fit more apps on the screen. The biggest deciding factor for many uses is the screen size, but there is more to it than just a larger screen. The 15-inch MacBook Pro includes more powerful processors and graphics as well as larger storage options. 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Performance Apple packs more power into the 2016 MacBook Pro 15 than in the MacBook Pro 13. The 15-inch MacBook Pro starts with an Intel Core i7 Quad-Core processor and a dedicated AMD Radeon GPU and 16GB RAM. On the smaller 13-inch MacBook Pro users start with an Intel Core i5 dual-core processor, integrated Intel Graphics and 8GB of RAM. You can upgrade the 13-inch MacBook Pro to a faster processor and 16GB of RAM, but you will still be using a dual-core processor and integrated graphics. While they use the same ports, you can only connect two 5K displays to the 15-inch MacBook Pro at the same time. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is capable of powering one 5K display or two 4K displays. We’re waiting for specific 2016 MacBook Pro benchmarks to compare the integrated Iris graphics to the dedicated AMD Radeon Pro graphics, but we already know that the dedicated 15-inch MacBook Pro will be more powerful. Even with the difference in performance, the 2016 MacBook Pro battery life is the same 10 hours of web browsing across both of the models. 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Size and Weight The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is smaller than 13-inch MacBook Air and it is just as light, which makes it a very tempting choice for users who want portability. With a 15-inch MacBook Pro there is a larger footprint, but it is still smaller than the model it replaces. It’s not as small as the older 13-inch MacBook Pro, it takes up less space and weighs half a pound less than the one it replaces. How the 13-inch MAcBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro sizes compare. Head to head the 13-inch MacBook Pro is a pound lighter and 0.6 mm thinner than the 15-inch model. If portability trumps power, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is the one you need to look into. All of the new models include a larger touchpad that is 2X as large as the one on the 2015 MacBook Pro. 13-inch MacBook Pro vs 15-inch MacBook Pro Price You’ll need to spend $900 more to get the 15-inch MacBook Pro when you compare it to the 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar. 13-inch MacBook Pro – $1,499 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar – $1,799 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar – $2,399 You can customize the MacBook Pro models with many options including more RAM, more storage and by the time you add in everything you need and the dongles, the new MacBook Pro is more expensive than you think. You can get a student discount on the new MacBook Pro to save $50 to $200 and you can also check out how to get Apple financing to afford the new MacBook Pro. 2016 MacBook Pro: 5 Reasons to Buy, 4 Reasons Not To Buy for a Smaller Design & Touch Bar 1 / 9 One of the biggest reasons to wait for the 2016 MacBook Pro is the new design. The new MacBook Pro is thinner, lighter and smaller than the one it replaces.  Apple shaves half a pound of each of the models, shrinks the overall; size by 20 to 23% and makes them thinner without cutting battery life, performance or the screen size.  The new models include a Touch Bar above the display on the $1,799 and up models. This allows you to touch the small display to control applications and system functions.  When you use Apple applications and soon other applications, the Touch Bar will change so you can use it to quickly acccess what you want. We know you can use it for Emoji, for app functions, for quick replies and much more.  In addition to the Touch Bar, you also get a new Force Touch trackpad that is twice as big as the trackpad on the 2015 MacBook Pro.  1 / 9 5 Responses 10/29/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply No updates for the iMac, Mac Pro or Mac mini…..

A report claims that the Apple iPad 2017 release date will be delayed due to a supply chain issue. Because of this, production may take longer, and the new models may come out in March 2017. DigiTimes was the first to report about the Apple iPad 2017 release date delay. It can be recalled that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) will be the one to make Apple’s A10X chips for the new iPads. However, according to the publication, the March release schedule may not be followed due to the unsatisfactory yield rates for the company’s 10nm process. From 16nm to 10nm Apple’s devices currently have A10 chips which were produced via the 16-nanometer process. For the new-gen iPads, Apple is aiming to have the 10-nanometer chips as they will reportedly make the devices more efficient. The said chips are also ideal for the new models as it will provide a smoother and faster experience. With the current problem on low yields, 9 to 5 mac believes that TMSC will prioritize Apple over its other clients since the company is its highest-profile customer. Apparently, other companies that ordered 10nm chips from TMSC are Apple, HiSilicon, and MediaTek.

Reports claim that these are intended for the enterprise and education sectors. This does not mean though that the 9.7-inch model would scrapped. It would only be “pushed downmarket,” as the new 10.5-inch line will be the Pro model along with the 12.9 iPad. The news about the Apple iPad 2017 release date delay remains to be speculations at this point, however. We have to wait for Apple to officially announce the release dates for its new iPad models.

JULY “Illusory” GDP numbers put the international focus back on Ireland’s tax regime, as the CSO reported huge upward revisions to economic growth numbers in 2015 of 26.3%. The figures were described as “artificial” and “illusory” and promoted the infamous jibe of “leprechaun economics” by economist Paul Krugman. The numbers risk putting Ireland’s corporate tax regime back under the international spotlight, analysts warned. The CSO said capital transfers into Ireland last year led to “dramatic” revisions to the GDP growth numbers and mean the economy here supposedly surged in 2015, up from the 7.8% expansion in a preliminary estimate. READ NEXT Business year in review: January to June Experts said that, following the international tax crackdown led by the OECD, a small number of multinationals last year switched their capital assets from Caribbean tax havens into Ireland. The Irish Examiner reports the transfer by Apple of huge amounts of intellectual property into Ireland amid a re- arrangement of its international tax affairs was the main driver behind the surge. The Irish economy could grow by 50%, over the next four years, with 140,000 jobs created if the country can take a leading role in the creation of the EU’s planned Digital Single Market, according to a Google commissioned report. Despite a previous report last year over 90% of Irish and European tech firms are not prepared for a harmonisation of technology and digital regulation across member states, the Google study said Ireland stands to be one of the main beneficiaries. The research, by Boston Consulting Group, bracketed Ireland with the likes of the Benelux nations, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states as European ‘digital frontrunners’. Ireland could join the group of well- digitised, export-dependent and innovative small countries largely driven by the information and communications technology industry. “Ireland’s e-GDP — as a share of total GDP — is the highest of comparable countries, at over 12%, excluding multinational corporations,” said Boston Consulting’s Niclas Colliander. Average land prices dipped 1.5% to €9,650 per acre in the six months to June, according to a survey by Sherry Fitzgerald estate agents. This reversal follows modest but steady upward price movement during 2015, with the most marked price deflation found in the south-west, which can be largely attributed to the Cork market, where agri-land prices appeared to be particularly challenged. The average price of land in the south-west fell by 2.2% in the three months to June, bringing the fall in value in the year to date to a significant 3.5%. That said, the South-West remained one of the most expensive markets, where prime grassland stands at approximately at €11,750 per acre, and prime arable land at €12,500 per acre. Businesses are struggling to combat the rise of cyber criminality which continues to grow increasingly sophisticated, according to a major new report. A range of constraints including aging infrastructure, poor employee habits and limited resources are hampering firms’ fight back against attackers and leaving them vulnerable to potentially seriously damaging attacks. According to Cisco’s report, the struggle to constrain the time and space afforded to cyber criminals is the biggest challenge facing businesses and threatens their ability to fully embrace the digital economy. “To close attackers’ windows of opportunity, customers will require more visibility into their networks and must improve activities, like patching and retiring aging infrastructure lacking in advanced security capabilities,” Cisco security business group vice president Marty Roesch said. The National Competitiveness Council issued its annual report designed to alert people to the need to address gaps in the nation’s economy, with the high cost of housing and credit singled out for attention. “Rising costs remains a key concern of the council, there is an urgent need to address the supply and affordability of residential property,” said chairman Peter Clinch, adding that high rents and house prices were making Ireland “a less attractive location” for skilled migrants and emigrants considering a return home. AUGUST Growth in Irish manufacturing shuddered to a halt last month, largely as a result of the drop in sterling following the decision of the UK to quit the EU. The Investec Ireland survey of Irish purchasing managers posted a reading of 50.2, down from 53 in June. The survey was the weakest reading for 38 months, and also showed that new business “stagnated” in the month. For the first time since June 2013, no meaningful rise was recorded in new orders, with some purchasing managers blaming the Brexit vote for the reading. “While we draw a modicum of reassurance from the relatively modest declines in both new orders and new export orders, our sense is that conditions in the Irish manufacturing sector are likely to get worse before they get better,” said Philip O’Sullivan, chief economist at Investec Ireland. The country’s main tourism industry group warned that any UK recession sparked by the Brexit vote will directly hit Ireland, and urged the Government to make the reduced Vat rate tax an untouchable part of the tax code here. The Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC) said the drop in the value of sterling against the euro made the UK “a better-value” destination for overseas’ tourists, potentially damaging Ireland’s tourism industry. The ITIC wants the Government to keep in mind the importance of the industry and the almost 227,850 people the industry employs, and make good its promise to fully restore its international promotional budget to pre-crisis levels. It also pleaded at the time that the reduced Vat tax of 9% should be a “pillar” in the same way that the 12.5% corporation tax is widely accepted as a permanent fixture of Ireland’s tax code. The drop in sterling following the UK decision to leave the EU is now the main risk facing the Irish economy and has led to the sharpest fall in business sentiment since the bailout in 2010, according to a major survey of business confidence. Since the unexpected outcome of the June 23 Brexit vote, sterling has slumped 13% against the euro, making it more difficult for a wide variety of Irish businesses who employ tens of thousands of people to sell their goods across the Irish Sea. The survey by KBC Bank Ireland and Chartered Accountants Ireland said that Brexit, along with other concerns about world demand and the political instability at home, has led to the sharpest drop in sentiment since the third quarter of 2010. Apple received planning permission for an expansion at its European head office in Cork that is due to provide an additional 1,000 jobs. The plan by the iPhone maker comprises a four-storey office block and 752 car spaces. The additional jobs will bring Apple’s workforce in Cork to 6,000. It is likely the new development will come on stream in 2017, allowing for a construction period of five months, and Apple has confirmed that 200 workers will be employed during construction. SEPTEMBER The UK’s economic resilience following Brexit encouraged some economists to rethink their short-term forecasts. Deutsche Bank has exited a bet for sterling to fall on a trade-weighted basis, while retaining its longer-term negative view on the UK currency. UniCredit said it had closed a short pound-dollar position, or a wager that sterling would weaken, to reduce “tactical” risk. Reports such as an index of August services, which jumped the most on record when it was published, gave a more positive view of the UK economy in the wake of the June 23 vote to leave the EU than many had predicted. “Recent data suggest the near-term confidence impact of Brexit may have been overstated, and with risks the Bank of England now sound a more sanguine note, we take profit on our May recommendation to bet against the pound on a trade-weighted basis,” said London-based Deutsche Bank strategist Oliver Harvey. Strong trading levels at its Irish operations helped drive an estimated 9% rise in sales at discount clothing retailer Primark in its latest financial year. The Associated British Foods-owned retailer is headquartered here and trades in the Republic as Penneys. It said that its full-year sales were expected to be ahead of the previous year on a constant currency basis. “Ireland delivered a strong performance throughout the year,” it said. “Spain, France, and Austria traded well and the Netherlands and Germany improved. The UK performance was in line with the group and good trading in periods of more typically seasonal weather.” Retailers are missing out on billions of euro worth of trade every year as consumers continue to do the bulk of their online shopping overseas, according to research by Virgin Media. The value of goods bought online by Irish consumers has continued to increase over the past two years, growing 13% to €7.5bn — growth that is expected to not only continue but accelerate to over €14bn in annual online sales by 2021. While the growth of e-commerce presents a golden chance for web-savvy firms, the fear is that many SMEs are missing out on significant revenues. “Ever increasing numbers of Irish consumers are shopping and using services online. This is seen in the increase in spending over the last two years and the projected forecast for online consumer spending to grow from €7.5bn to €14.1bn in 2021,” said Tony Hanway, the chief executive of Virgin Media. “Irish websites account for just 41% — some €3.1bn — of Irish online purchases, with a further €4.4bn being spent offshore. The European Commission is not demanding any changes in Irish tax laws over the Apple arrangement condemned by Brussels, according to Minister for Finance Michael Noonan. “It’s part of the Irish offering now for years,” said Mr Noonan. “We could nearly put it on the flag now, because everybody knows what the rate is. When industrialists think of Ireland, they automatically think of 12.5%. Just in case there’s any doubt, I’ll confirm it again in this year’s budget.” Mr Noonan was speaking at the announcement of 100 jobs in Limerick by US digital website hosting service provider WP Engine, and said employment has grown to just 100,000 below the level at the height of the Celtic Tiger era. “Over the past year, more than 56,000 additional people are at work — bringing those at work to more than 2m,” he said. “The Celtic Tiger was a false economy built on one sector, building and development. The difference now is that in job creation, the economy is growing across all sectors.” OCTOBER The Irish economy will grow at a “significantly” slower pace and the possibility of a recession in Europe cannot be ruled out as it faces into key elections in Germany and France next year, according to Merrion Capital. In its latest quarterly outlook, Merrion cut its Irish growth forecast to 3.5% this year from 4.8% in its previous outlook, and has pared back 2017 growth to 3.2% from 3.8% previously. The outcome of the federal election in Germany and the presidential vote in France could well decide the future of the EU and unsettle economies and markets for some time, warned chief economist Alan McQuaid. “The international headwinds include the potential for a European recession. Europe has considerable vulnerabilities, of which the banking system is a prime worry,” he said. Twitter shares fell 12% on the day after potential bidders were said to have lost interest in making offers to buy the company. The social media company had attracted interest from Google, Salesforce.com, and Walt Disney, all of which had consulted with banks on whether to pursue a bid. The stock was down to $17.31 at one stage, having closed at $24.87 earlier in the month after reports emerged that some companies were mulling an offer. In October, the shares hade lost a quarter of their value since the start of the year. The company has been entering partnerships for sports, politics, and entertainment content — such as American football games — that it can stream alongside tweets related to the video. Dublin Port said it is taking on so much business it will need to expand, setting aside fears that Brexit would severely disrupt its trade. “We think the effect of Brexit on Dublin Port’s business will be much, much smaller than the impact of the recession post-2007, and we think we will double our 2010 volumes by 2032,” said chief executive Eamonn O’Reilly. “Our challenge now is how best to create additional port capacity in sufficient time to stay ahead of this growth.” The port said its master plan includes developing 44 hectares of land which lies some 14km from the existing port over the next five years. Total trade volumes — which include both imports and exports — climbed to 26m tonnes in the first nine months this year, up 6.8% from the same period in 2015. The decision by a Canadian firm to buy Ireland’s only refinery at Whitegate in Cork Harbour ensures security of supply and contributes to the country’s economic growth, Environment Minister Denis Naughten said. “It is crucially important from the point of view this is the only oil refinery on the island of Ireland,” he said. “It is much easier to access crude oil than processed oils — petrol and diesel — so it is important from a security point of view that we have an oil refinery on the island. It is not just an Irish issue. It is a European issue as well.” Irving Oil views Whitegate as a key element in expanding their business in Europe. Whitegate supplies up to 40% of the main products on the Irish market, and was privatised as a result of its sale by the State in 2001 to Phillips 66. NOVEMBER A former Nama board member described the hugely controversial Project Eagle deal which allegedly saw taxpayers lose out on €200m as an “inspired” transaction. John Mulcahy, the former head of asset management for the State property group, told a meeting of the Dáil public accounts committee he fully supported the deal. “My view would be that to shift the entire Northern Ireland portfolio in one go for €1.3bn was an inspired transaction,” said Mr Mulcahy. “I didn’t need to see a lot of cash flow to know it was a superb deal. I never liked the Northern Ireland portfolio, it was difficult.” It was a perfect opportunity, he said, as it would “bring in cash” at a time when there was significant pressure from the ECB on the Republic to sell-out distressed assets. Ryanair shares jumped more than 5% on the day after the company offered an upbeat outlook, despite Brexit uncertainties, and approved a plan to return another €550m to shareholders. The airline’s first-half results showed a 7% year-on-year rise in after-tax profit, to almost €1.17bn. Revenues jumped 2% to over €4.13bn as passenger numbers grew 12% to just under 65m people.   Ryanair said in Novermber it expected to carry more than 119 m passengers across its Europe-wide route network in its current financial year, which runs to the end of next March. The knock-on effect is the company upping its long-term traffic forecast by 10%, meaning management now sees more than 200m customers a year flying with Ryanair by March 2024. Sterling clawed back some ground against the dollar and the euro, as markets continued to sift through the potential implications of Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the US presidential election. A number of banks said they expected the dollar to strengthen next year on the back of higher US yields and inflation, which would put more pressure on the pound against the dollar, as London starts formal talks on an exit from the EU. Irish-based analysts have long said that the euro’s surge against sterling this year could be stopped in its tracks, on the outcome of key national elections in France and Germany in 2017. “Trump in the White House will help the pound,” said Derek Halpenny, European head of global market research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in London. “The UK Brexit vote will no longer be viewed as some kind of outlier vote but perhaps the beginning of a global shift towards more populist voting.” Supermac’s fast food and hotels group saw pre-tax profits double to €14m, as it broke through the €100m barrier in annual revenues for the first time, with income soaring by 24.5% to €116m. Owner Pat McDonagh has diversified, and his four hotels contributed to the growth in revenues. November saw the opening of the 106th Supermac’s outlet, in Charlestown, Co Mayo, with further plans to open four or five more outlets next year. DECEMBER Vietnam is expected to be the fastest-growing destination for Irish exporters in the next decade, closely followed by China, India and Malaysia, as companies continue to look east to boost trade levels. On a combined basis, the three countries are expected to account for around 40% of the total growth in Irish merchandise exports, HSBC said in its latest Irish trade forecast. Cork-based retail group Musgrave is to start exporting SuperValu products to China after sealing a deal with internet giant Alibaba. Musgrave, which controls the SuperValu and Centra brands here, will use Alibaba’s e-commerce platform to sell SuperValu breakfast cereals, coffee, jam, biscuits and other products to consumers. Musgrave will initially offer 40 own-brand products for sale online, selling directly to Chinese consumers — the first Irish company with a presence on the platform — and will have a SuperValu storefront on the global website. Irish SMEs warned the UK’s exit from the EU was significantly more negative for Ireland’s economy than the election of Donald Trump in the US. A survey of 100 export-focused SMEs who regularly use short-stay visas for business travel found that while Mr Trump’s presidency will impact negatively on Ireland, and a majority said Brexit would hit harder. Residential construction edged in pole position as the most active section of the building industry, according to the Ulster Bank Purchasing Managers Index. November’s activity levels were “at a pace slightly ahead of the average seen in the sector’s three-year recovery to date”, according to Ulster Bank chief economist Simon Barry. The Government proposed introducing rent caps of 4% for Cork City and Dublin, and will consider introducing the controls in other cities.

With our iPhones and iPads becoming a frequent tool in our work and personal lives, security is extremely valuable. There are multiple apps now that contain personal information such as credit card info, personal addresses and more. With the usage of this personal information being so necessary, security is one of Apple’s highest priorities. With the release of the iPhone 5S, Apple introduced Touch ID and its new way of ensuring device security. Advertisement Handling iPhone Security With Touch ID and Passcode Here are the steps to enable Touch ID and Passcode options and the ways we use them within iOS. Watch the above video for more information on how to use Touch ID and a Passcode to ensure your personal information is safe. Using Touch ID and Passcode Touch ID is part of the home button on your iPhone and will allow you to record your fingerprint in order to secure your device. Many users do not want to have a passcode lock on their iPhone for whatever reason, yet Touch ID is a very useful alternative to having to input your code in every time you unlock. Advertisement In order to set up Touch ID after setup or add additional fingerprints, you can navigate to Settings and then Touch ID and Passcode. You will be prompted for your passcode (if you have one enabled) and then you can unlock the settings for Touch ID. Advertisement You will see options on what you can use the Touch ID for on your device. The most common is to unlock your iPhone yet you can also use it for Apple Pay and iTunes and App Store purchases. As mentioned above, Touch ID is important for security due to the fingerprint authentication. You can add up to five fingerprints on your device so adding additional fingerprints can be done at any time within this window. This is also a great way for parents to monitor purchases from their account by requiring physical authentication to proceed. Tapping Add Fingerprint, will allow you to add another map of your print or that of a friend or spouse that you want to give access to. Adding additional fingerprints of the same finger will actually decrease the Touch ID read time and unlock faster. Advertisement You can disable the Passcode if you would like yet this is definitely not a recommended behavior especially if you do use your iPhone in public places. You can also designate how quickly your phone requires your passcode. If you have your Touch ID set to Unlock your Device, you will only have the option for Immediately. The last sections within this settings tab are regarding Allowing Access When Locked. There are certain behaviors from iOS that you can limit if your iPhone screen is locked such as Today View, Notifications View, Siri and more. You may want to limit these depending on how much security you want on your data. If you tend to leave your phone laying around your office and are not nearby, you may not want your private messages appearing on the lock screen and have someone be able to reply. You can change any of the sliders to limit what is available when the iPhone is locked. This is also a great setting to adjust if you have small children using your iPhone and don’t want them to interact with your important data if it is locked. Your fingerprint data is stored locally on your device so it is not able to be recovered from a server anywhere. This is an integral part of why Touch ID is an effective security measure. If your phone falls into the wrong hands, they will not be able to access your data without your passcode or fingerprint. You can also lastly add an option to Erase all data on the phone after ten failed attempts. This is a great security measure for a phone that is lost or stolen yet is a feature that should only be used if you have a current backup. Touch ID and Passcode are essential parts of iOS to ensure the security of your data and it is always recommended to use at least a passcode for your iPhone as you go out into the world. Using these features will give you peace of mind that your iPhone is secure on a device level and that your personal information is kept locked tight without your fingerprint.

It was a year that many decried Apple’s lack of innovation, but others noted that at least Apple’s products didn’t explode in your face (see Samsung Galaxy Note 7). Many blame Apple’s alleged “lack of innovation” on Tim Cook, while others think people are expecting too much from Apple, who consistently delivers good products that, more than anything, just work. Let’s take a look at Apple’s biggest releases in 2016… MacBook In April, Apple updated its 12-inch MacBook with some minor improvements, including an updated processor, an update to battery life, and an even better screen. Apple claimed to make improvements to the Butterfly keyboard as well, but that has been debated. Even though the MacBook received decent reviews, it didn’t make much more of an impact than 2015’s MacBook did. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus has been a big hit in 2016. [Image by Daryl Deino] Long before the release of Apple’s 2017 smartphones, there were rumors that Apple would completely eliminate the headphone jack. Unfortunately, at least for some, those rumors ended up being true. BGR thought that Apple did a bad job of justifying leaving this out, while The Verge thought Apple was being downright hostile to users. It ends up Apple provided a simple dongle for headphone compatibility, but people still complained. By most accounts, Apple released a solid update to the iPhone, and the iPhone 7 Plus — especially — received great reviews. Computerworld said that the 7 Plus was the best iPhone yet, and CNET gave the 7 plus an almost perfect four-and-a-half stars. Apple Watch Series 2 The new Apple watch perfected the first version. [Image by Daryl Deino] The first Apple Watch failed to conquer the marketplace the way Apple thought it would, but the Watch still had a loyal following. In September, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 2, which was more powerful, faster, and had a better battery life than the original. It also had its own integrated GPS. The only thing the new Apple Watch didn’t have was cellular capabilities, but that can very well change with the Apple Watch Series 3. MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Over the past month and a half, the new MacBook Pro series has proven to be Apple’s most controversial product this year. It may even be Apple’s most controversial product ever. Both the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros have been called innovative by many and awful by others. CNET says that the 13-inch version is Apple’s “second screen dream machine,” while Consumer Reports says they can’t recommend either the 13-inch or 15-inch versions because of poor battery life. An Inquisitr article noted that the battery life isn’t perfect, but that Consumer Report‘s article could be “fake news” clickbait. Most new MacBook Pro owners have praised their new notebooks. It appears as if the biggest critics of the new MacBook Pro don’t own or haven’t even tried out the device. Apple is currently working with Consumer Reports to find out what is causing the tests to show poor battery life. AirPods It looks like Apple is ending the year on a high note. When the AirPods (the wireless version of Apple’s regular EarPods) were first announced, many laughed. After all, several different companies such as Samsung have tried wireless earbuds, and have only received collective yawns from consumers. But Apple is known for taking what others have failed at and making those products marketable. “The AirPods are pretty great. Their strange design does present some problems—but not the ones everyone’s complaining about,” says David Pogue of Yahoo Finance. He adds that not only do the AirPods not fall out of your ears but that the sound is also really good as well. It looks like a lot of people agree with Pogue; Apple’s AirPods are nearly impossible to find in stores just seven days after the initial release date.

Thanks to Matthew Roberts, who just recently shot some jaw-dropping footage of Tesla’s Gigafactory, we now have some new 4K drone footage of Apple’s new campus to enjoy as well. With Apple planning to run its new building using 100% renewable energy, taking a close look at the solar panels on top of the structure is particularly interesting. Per the video, Roberts estimates that installation of solar panels is about 65% complete at this point. Don't Miss: A man waited 416 days to see what happened when his iPod stopwatch passed 9,999 hours Apple’s Spaceship campus was originally conceived by Steve Jobs in 2011 as a direct response to the incredible amount of growth Apple was experiencing at the time. Apple was initially hoping to finish the project by 2015 but the entire operation was beset by a variety of minor delays. One of the cooler design aspects of the building is that the exterior of the building will consist of 3,000 specially designed and engineered curved glass panels that, taken together, will measure in at about one mile in circumference. “There’s not a single straight piece of glass in this building,” Jobs said during a Cupertino City Council meeting a few years ago. “We’ve used our experience in building retail buildings all over the world. We know how to make the biggest pieces of glass for architectural use. And, we want to make the glass specifically for this building here. We can make it curve all the way around the building… It’s pretty cool.” Trending right now: 10 movies you need to watch on Netflix this week before they expire A man waited 416 days to see what happened when his iPod stopwatch passed 9,999 hours Growing number of Pixel owners are experiencing a wide range of issues See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next 9 tech-friendly gifts for people obsessed with travel Yahoo Tech Credit Cards With Massive Rewards Have Arrived CreditCards.comSponsored CNN uses screenshot from ‘Fallout 4’ to show how Russians hack things BGR News Facebook launches live 360-degree video feature Yahoo Tech LG is ready to make the future more colorful with its Super UHD TVs at CES 2017 Digital Trends 2017: The Year of Marijuana Millionaires MONEY MORNINGSponsored The battle between SSD and HDD is over, and the winner is clear Digital Trends Celebrity sues Tesla, claims Model X drove itself through a wall and into his house BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

Apple leaps into AI research with improved simulated + unsupervised learning Posted Dec 26, 2016 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story No Signal: Egypt blocks the encrypted messaging app as it continues its cyber crackdown Corporate machine learning research may be getting a new vanguard in Apple. Six researchers from the company’s recently formed machine learning group published a paper that describes a novel method for simulated + unsupervised learning. The aim is to improve the quality of synthetic training images. The work is a sign of the company’s aspirations to become a more visible leader in the ever growing field of AI. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and the rest of the techstablishment have been steadily growing their machine learning research groups. With hundreds of publications each, these companies’ academic pursuits have been well documented, but Apple has been stubborn — keeping its magic all to itself. Things started to change earlier this month when Apple’s Director of AI Research, Russ Salakhutdinov, announced that the company would soon begin publishing research. The team’s first attempt is both timely and pragmatic. In recent times, synthetic images and videos have been used with greater frequency to train machine learning models. Rather than use cost and time intensive real-world imagery, generated images are less costly, readily available and customizable. The technique presents a lot of potential, but it’s risky because small imperfections in synthetic training material can have serious negative implications for a final product. Put another way, it’s hard to ensure generated images meet the same quality standards as real images. Apple is proposing to use Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs to improve the quality of these synthetic training images. GANs are not new, but Apple is making modifications to serve its purpose. At a high level, GANs work by taking advantage of the adversarial relationship between competing neural networks. In Apple’s case, a simulator generates synthetic images that are run through a refiner. These refined images are then sent to a discriminator that’s tasked with distinguishing real images from synthetic ones.   From a game theory perspective, the networks are competing in a two-player minimax game. The goal in this type of game is to minimize the maximum possible loss. Apple SimGAN variation is trying to minimize both local adversarial loss and a self regulation term.  These terms simultaneously minimize the differences between synthetic and real images while minimizing the difference between synthetic and refined images to retain annotations. The idea here is that too much alteration can destroy the value of the unsupervised training set. If trees no-longer look like trees and the point of your model is to help self-driving cars recognize trees to avoid, you’ve failed. The researchers also made some fine-tuned modifications, like forcing the models to use the full history of refined images, not just those from the mini-batch, to ensure the adversarial network can identify all generated images as fake at any given time. You can read more about these alterations directly from Apple’s work, entitled Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training.  0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

With our iPhones and iPads becoming a frequent tool in our work and personal lives, security is extremely valuable. There are multiple apps now that contain personal information such as credit card info, personal addresses and more. With the usage of this personal information being so necessary, security is one of Apple’s highest priorities. With the release of the iPhone 5S, Apple introduced Touch ID and its new way of ensuring device security. Advertisement Handling iPhone Security With Touch ID and Passcode Here are the steps to enable Touch ID and Passcode options and the ways we use them within iOS. Watch the above video for more information on how to use Touch ID and a Passcode to ensure your personal information is safe. Using Touch ID and Passcode Touch ID is part of the home button on your iPhone and will allow you to record your fingerprint in order to secure your device. Many users do not want to have a passcode lock on their iPhone for whatever reason, yet Touch ID is a very useful alternative to having to input your code in every time you unlock. Advertisement In order to set up Touch ID after setup or add additional fingerprints, you can navigate to Settings and then Touch ID and Passcode. You will be prompted for your passcode (if you have one enabled) and then you can unlock the settings for Touch ID. Advertisement You will see options on what you can use the Touch ID for on your device. The most common is to unlock your iPhone yet you can also use it for Apple Pay and iTunes and App Store purchases. As mentioned above, Touch ID is important for security due to the fingerprint authentication. You can add up to five fingerprints on your device so adding additional fingerprints can be done at any time within this window. This is also a great way for parents to monitor purchases from their account by requiring physical authentication to proceed. Tapping Add Fingerprint, will allow you to add another map of your print or that of a friend or spouse that you want to give access to. Adding additional fingerprints of the same finger will actually decrease the Touch ID read time and unlock faster. Advertisement You can disable the Passcode if you would like yet this is definitely not a recommended behavior especially if you do use your iPhone in public places. You can also designate how quickly your phone requires your passcode. If you have your Touch ID set to Unlock your Device, you will only have the option for Immediately. The last sections within this settings tab are regarding Allowing Access When Locked. There are certain behaviors from iOS that you can limit if your iPhone screen is locked such as Today View, Notifications View, Siri and more. You may want to limit these depending on how much security you want on your data. If you tend to leave your phone laying around your office and are not nearby, you may not want your private messages appearing on the lock screen and have someone be able to reply. You can change any of the sliders to limit what is available when the iPhone is locked. This is also a great setting to adjust if you have small children using your iPhone and don’t want them to interact with your important data if it is locked. Your fingerprint data is stored locally on your device so it is not able to be recovered from a server anywhere. This is an integral part of why Touch ID is an effective security measure. If your phone falls into the wrong hands, they will not be able to access your data without your passcode or fingerprint. You can also lastly add an option to Erase all data on the phone after ten failed attempts. This is a great security measure for a phone that is lost or stolen yet is a feature that should only be used if you have a current backup. Touch ID and Passcode are essential parts of iOS to ensure the security of your data and it is always recommended to use at least a passcode for your iPhone as you go out into the world. Using these features will give you peace of mind that your iPhone is secure on a device level and that your personal information is kept locked tight without your fingerprint.

The company reverted to the old battery. DAVID PAUL MORRIS by Mark Gurman To die-hard fans, Apple's Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought these days. Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favourable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers.

View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements While the Mac generates about 10 per cent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky — opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad.   People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops.   An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets.  Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and centre in the company's product arsenal.  "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel, which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips — a process that's getting more difficult. Battery failure Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life.  In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen.  In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritised the iPhone, Apple reorganised its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power.  That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritises features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 per cent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power.  Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the colour didn't look good on such a large product.  In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable", a person familiar with the matter said.  When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop last year, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold colour option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads.  In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the US. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though.  The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome bevelled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the US.  Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," chief executive officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News.  The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar", a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley Look Ahead: Measure V vote, Yucca Loma Bridge and closed fire stations on the radar for 2017 Monday Dec 26, 2016 at 3:48 PM Dec 26, 2016 at 3:48 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — What will 2017 bring in the Town of Apple Valley? Here are five things that will be on the horizon in the new year. Measure V vote The town’s takeover attempt of Liberty Utilities, Apple Valley produced an onslaught of punch, counterpunch scenarios in 2016, with both sides assuming the offensive when openings presented themselves. In June, Liberty officials disclosed to the Daily Press the town’s unauthorized use of 869,000 gallons of company water on the Apple Valley Golf Course, a move that ran up a nearly $7,000 bill and led to criticism of the town’s ability to safely run a water system. And in October, Liberty’s General Manager Tony Penna let fly an ireful outburst directed at Councilor Curt Emick during a meeting that culminated with Penna’s removal from Council chambers and town officials calling his comments a threat of physical violence. Yet these incidents, though providers of intriguing fodder, were mere jabs in the grand scheme; never would either decide the future water provider in Apple Valley. Voters’ passage of Measure V on Nov. 8, however, carries the potential to significantly impact a future purchase, should the town win its eminent-domain case. If voters opt against the bond debt, the town will be forced to — at the very least — look elsewhere for financing. It’s unknown when the vote will occur; town officials say more discussion is required by the Council before a date is set. But with a trial setting conference scheduled for Jan. 7 — and litigation expected to move forward thereafter — 2017 could be the year of a vote on debt. Yucca Loma Bridge opening While work on the third and final phase of the Yucca Loma Corridor remains at least two years away, town officials celebrated completion of the Yucca Loma Bridge in 2016, over two years after construction commenced. And with widening work on the nearby Yucca Loma Road progressing ahead of schedule, 2017 will mark the long-anticipated opening of the bridge to traffic. The tentative schedule includes a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 19 and a community bike ride on May 20 before the opening on May 22. Because Victorville’s Green Tree Boulevard Extension project is still in design, it’s unlikely the opening will alleviate congestion along Bear Valley Road or Highway 18 in the short term. Still, the opening will be seen as a major accomplishment given that officials have talked of a bridge over the Mojave River since the 1960s, according to former Victorville City Councilman Ryan McEachron. Reopening of closed fire stations Funds provided by Measure A — the fire tax voters overwhelmingly passed in November — won’t be available until July, but 2017 could be the year two closed fire stations reopen. Apple Valley Fire Protection District Chief Sid Hultquist previously told the Daily Press the reopenings of stations 336 and 337 are “going to happen,” but he stopped short of providing a date. Staffing plans will be prepared in the interim, as the district’s board develops “timelines with the logistics needed to open” the stations that closed following the Great Recession. Hilltop House More than seven months have passed since the town officially took ownership of Newt Bass’ Hilltop House, but officials have been relatively quiet about future plans for the site outside of its eventual inclusion into the Parks and Recreation system. Per grant-program requirements, the town has three years from the acquisition date to create an “outdoor recreational opportunity for the public’s benefit,” so 2017 could be the year an ad hoc committee is formed to discuss what sort of recreational attraction the house will become. New year, new captain The promotion of San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department Capt. Lana Tomlin to deputy chief of all desert region stations will signal the return of Capt. Frank Bell to town next month. Bell previously worked as lieutenant at the Apple Valley Sheriff’s station before moving to headquarters in San Bernardino where he served as captain of the Employee Resources Unit. He will assume the captain role after Tomlin makes her own transition to headquarters on Jan. 21. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

By Matthew Miller for The Mobile Gadgeteer | December 26, 2016 -- 22:35 GMT (14:35 PST) | Topic: Mobility 2016 was another fantastic year in mobile technology where we find people using their smartphones as their primary source of information and social interaction. I've been blessed to now write here on ZDNet for more than a decade and look forward to an exciting 2017. This year-end post includes my ten most viewed posts from 2016, some "best of" titles for this year, answers to last year's questions, and questions I hope to have answered in 2017. Most viewed articles of 2016 7 small-screen smartphones: Can the 4-inch iPhone SE trump rivals? 10 best smartphones of 2016 so far iPhone 7 Plus case roundup: Speck and Tech21 provide drop protection in slim form Nationwide Cricket Wireless outage draws customer ire primarily due to lack of communications T-Mobile's free iPhone 7 offer requires upfront costs and lots of patience Running with the Apple Watch: Yes, you can leave your iPhone behind 10 ways to boost your productivity with the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 S Pen Android Wear 2.0 preview on a Huawei Watch: Significant UI changes and watch face complications 10 best smartphones for the 2016 holiday season Apple iPhone 7 Plus: 10 reasons to pick the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 instead see alo 10 best smartphones for the 2016 holiday season Now that Google has announced the Pixel smartphones, it is time to see what Matthew Miller considers the ten best smartphones available. Read More Smartphones dominated my most popular posts of 2016 with the Apple iPhone the primary subject of four posts. Readers seem to enjoy my picks for best smartphones and after CES and Mobile World Congress in January and February, you can expect my next list in early 2017. At this time, the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL, Moto Z Force Droid, and Huawei Mate 9 are fighting for my attention on a daily basis. Despite the fact that the wearable market continues to struggle to gain consumer attention, two of my 10 most viewed posts were about the Apple Watch and Android Wear smartwatches. The Garmin Fenix 3 HR and Samsung Gear S3 were the subjects of three more articles in the next 10 most viewed articles I wrote here on ZDNet. Best of 2016 I have a few titles I would like to award to the devices, accessories, and software I checked out in 2016. Best overall smartphone: I recently posted my 10 best smartphones for the 2016 holiday season with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus earning my top pick. If the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 did not have a faulty battery design, it would have been my top pick. Best smartphone surprise: When Motorola launched the Moto X, I was a huge fan because of the price, customizability, and fact that software updates appeared as fast as a Nexus device. The Moto phones fell off my radar after the Lenovo purchase, but I've been pleasantly surprised and impressed by the new Verizon Moto Z Force Droid that received the Nougat update quickly while also being a phone that offers more than a Google Pixel XL. It has a shatterproof display, water repellant coating, modular design that is actually useful, expandable microSD storage, and handy Moto Actions to improve your efficiency. Rodney Dangerfield award (Best device that lacks the respect it deserves): LG continues to release excellent smartphones and with the failure of the Note 7 I expected the new LG V20 to do better than it has. LG phones deserve more attention and respect. The LG V20 has an excellent camera, microSD storage card, removable battery, and shipped with Android Nougat. Best Android smartphone: With the death of the Galaxy Note 7, choosing the Google Pixel XL as the best Android smartphone is an easy choice. It's battery seems to last forever and it reminds me of an iPhone running Android. While it's hard for me to pinpoint exactly why I can't put it down, the Pixel XL doesn't disappoint. Best iOS smartphone: This one is easy as Apple only launches a couple new phones each year. Apple iPhone 7 Plus is clearly the best Apple smartphone of 2016. It is similar to the iPhone 7, but the dual camera adds a fun portrait mode while the battery life also satisfies. Best BlackBerry device: I honestly didn't think I would have a BlackBerry to include on this list, but the DTEK60 is fantastic. BlackBerry no longer makes the hardware, but they worked with TCL to launch a powerful, attractive, and inexpensive flagship with the DTEK60. Android works well with BlackBerry Hub integration and the only thing I would like to see is a bit longer battery life. Best tablet: The Surface Pro 4 is my favorite computer ever and I personally also use it as my primary tablet. CNET has a list of the best tablets of 2016 and would agree that the Apple iPad Pro 9.7 is probably the best, non-PC tablet available. Best smartwatch: The new Apple Watch Series 2 is excellent, but I'm giving my top pick to the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier thanks to an integrated cellular connection, water and dust resistance, GPS, watch-optimized OS, and the ability to work with any Android smartphone. Best daily activity tracker: Fitbit is the Kleenex of the wearable world and having recently acquired some Pebble assets, it is definitely the company to beat. The Fitbit Charge 2 is the best wristband tracker available today. The Fitbit Blaze is a great tracker too, but comes in a watch form factor that is not as subtle as the Charge 2. Best GPS sport watch: I've spent years, and hundreds of dollars, trying out different GPS sports watches to track my running and cycling. I finally splurged this year and bought the expensive Garmin Fenix 3 HR and it does everything I could ever want while having a battery life that lasts me at least a week. It's a big watch, but has proven to be the best wearable I have ever purchased and I couldn't be any more pleased. Responses to questions from 2015 Will Microsoft finally give up on smartphone hardware?: The Lumia 950/950 XL have been on a fire sale recently and there continue to be rumors of a possible Surface phone. We didn't see anything new from Microsoft in 2016 and I'm not holding out much hope for anything in 2017 either. Will Android turn BlackBerry around?: I wouldn't say that Android has turned BlackBerry around, but the latest DTEK phones are receiving high ratings from reviewers and there are strong rumors of a successor to the BlackBerry PRIV. There is still a long road ahead to convince businesses that BlackBerry is the choice for a secure Android device, but high quality hardware like the DTEK60 may help. Will HTC get out of the smartphone business?: Not yet. The HTC 10 was released in 2016 and it's a solid device that didn't get as much respect as it deserved. HTC made the new Google Pixel phone so while it is possible HTC may get out of the branding business, maybe the company will become Google's preferred hardware maker. What's next in wearable tech?: I'm not sure what can be done to make wearables more attractive to consumers. The latest Apple Watch and Samsung Gear S3 do everything you could want in a wearable and there's not much more to be developed here. Battery life remains the biggest hurdle to overcome. What's going to be changed in the next iPhone?: Apple's iPhone line continues a similar form factor and we saw the expected new processor and an improved camera. The dual camera with bokeh portrait mode is a nice addition. The move away from a physical button took some getting used to, but makes sense in moving forward. The lack of a headphone jack still annoys me, but thankfully high quality Bluetooth headsets are available. Here are a few questions I have for 2017: Will VR become more popular now that Google Daydream is available? Will Huawei/Honor grow mindshare in the US market? Will wearables continue to stumble along and will other wearable companies go under? What's going to be changed in the next iPhone and Nexus? Looking ahead to 2017 I have a few Huawei phones I am testing right now and the company has moved into third place behind Samsung and Apple in worldwide market share. The phones are high quality with some excellent capability, but it remains to be seen if Huawei can show some success in the US. The Google Pixel/Pixel XL phones are the first Google-branded phones and both continue to have limited stock. I am excited about the next Pixel offering and the possibility of Google smartwatches too. Given that I like to write about the latest and greatest here on ZDNet, it's likely that I will sell my existing devices and pick up the next big iPhone, next Samsung Galaxy Note, and maybe the next Pixel smartphone. What was your favorite smartphone, tablet, or wearable of the year? How about your worst?

The company has been working with Foxconn on the efforts, the report explains, further strengthening the partnership between the two parties. Specifically, Apple is expected to begin constructing two new research and development centers in 2017. One is said to be located in Indonesia, while the other is  destined for Shenzhen, China, Apple announced in October. For what it’s worth, Foxconn currently has a presence in Indonesia, working with local vendor Luna as well as Huawei in the country. Foxconn wouldn’t, however, comment on today’s report. This isn’t the first we’ve heard of Apple’s plans in Indonesia. Last month, it was reported that the company was planning research and development centers in the country. The report claimed that Apple would announce the plans in December and begin construction and recruitment during 2017. Likewise, Reuters reported earlier this month that Apple was investing $44 million over three years in an R&D center in India. There has been speculation that Apple’s establishment of a center is a quid pro quo for a license allowing the company to sell LTE products in Indonesia. Indonesia is similar to India in that in order to establish a retail store in the country, companies must have some sort of manufacturing or research facilities there as well. The Shenzhen R&D center will allow for Apple’s engineering team to work “even more closely and collaboratively” with manufacturing partners, it said. What’s arguably most notable about today’s report is that Apple is further deepening its ties with Foxconn for its Shenzhen and Indonesian expansion. A strong relationship with Foxconn means Apple will have the capability of expanding throughout the world at a faster pace. Earlier this month, it was reported that Foxconn had been discussing a potential expansion to the United States, believed to be worth $7 billion and 50,000 jobs. A move to the United States by Foxconn, given its relationship with Apple, would be huge news for the iPhone maker. At this point, however, it’s Foxconn’s ever-growing relationship with Apple that will be interesting to watch.

Most of the news that has been coming out has been one complaint after another, ranging from GPU issues to battery life. We finally have our 2016 15″ MacBook Pro in-house and this is our initial brief thoughts and first impressions of Apple’s latest Pro laptop after having used it for the past five days. Specifications Our 2016 15″ MacBook Pro has the following features and specifications: Processor: 2.9GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM Graphics: Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB VRAM Flash Storage: 1TB PCIe-based SSD Ports: Four Thunderbolt 3 ports and 1 headphone jack Display: 2880×1800 Retina display TouchBar ForceTouch TrackPad Backlit Butterfly keyboard TouchBar There are varying thoughts on the TouchBar and its usefulness. Some seem to enjoy using it and some call it a gimmick. I found that some controls within the TouchBar were useful having around but it’s certainly not life changing technology at this point. The argument from some is Apple should embrace touchscreens much as Windows 10 has, but I’m not much of a touchscreen user. The TouchBar gives me some interesting control over certain functions and I like it just fine and despite others saying it’s not intuitive, I find it fits my workflow just fine. TrackPad What can I say about Apple’s TrackPad other than I still think it’s the best damn TrackPad on any laptop period. The two changes here are ForceTouch and the sheer size of the TrackPad — it’s huge. Many have complained that their palms rest on the TrackPad while typing and that palm-rejection software was a mixed bag. The way I rest my hands on the laptop I have yet to have my palms hit the TrackPad and I like having the extra real estate. However, I can see how different typing styles might find the TrackPad a problem. Keyboard The keyboard is a mix between the 2015 MacBook Pro and the 2015 12″ MacBook. The 2nd generation Butterfly keys are much improved over the 1st generation. Not everyone is going to like this keyboard, it is true that it is louder than last years model but I enjoyed typing on it much more than the 12″ MacBook. The backlighting is much improved here as well and overall I’ve been having a great keyboard experience. Build quality Apple’s build quality is still among the best in terms of materials and design. The machine feels solid and it’s crazy thin (though I would have liked a bigger battery instead of thin) and the hinge mechanism is now one piece of aluminum eliminating that gaudy plastic hinge. Display The resolution on this display is the same as last year’s but the nits and the color gamut are vastly improved and it shows. This is simply the best display I’ve seen on a MacBook Pro in a long time. The color gamut is also much improved and colors just pop off the display, blacks are deep and rich and whites are true. Ports One of the most controversial things about the 2016 15″ MacBook Pro are the 4 USB Type-C/Thunderbolt ports. Apple pretty much killed every legacy port but the headphone jack — ironic isn’t it — and have fully adopted USB Type-C. I don’t actually mind this, I currently am using a Satechi multiport adapter to give me my USB 3.0 ports back but it’s not that bad. The removal of the SD card slot doesn’t bother me either as I just plug my Sony a6300 into the USB 3.0 port on the adapter. I fully understand that the workflow of many users is much different than mine and the removal of these ports is something they should most certainly by upset by. Personally, the only port I miss is the MagSafe connector. I think this should have been kept as it has saved my Mac from being splattered many times, for now, I’m using Griffin’s Breaksafe cable, which isn’t the best solution but it works. Battery life This is the biggest controversy lately with the 2016 15″ MacBook Pro. Users have been reporting that battery life is dismal on the new MacBook Pro line in general and Consumer Reports has tested this as well and for the first time is not recommending this laptop to consumers. We’ve had a mixed bag of results in regard to battery life,  the first day was the worst with just over 4 hours of battery life with Apple Music playing, light Photoshop, browsing, email and writing posts in WordPress. Over the next few days, battery life did improve but I’ve yet to get more than 6 hours of battery life on a near $4000USD machine that Apple says should get 10 hours of battery life. I also noticed the fans kick in fast and hard whenever I used the laptop on a soft surface like a bed or on the carpet and the battery drained much faster in these instances. Overall Apple has a lot of work to do in this department and had better make those improvements quick. Speakers One word, amazing! These speakers are among the best I’ve heard on a laptop and I love them. Wrap Up The 15″ MacBook Pro has long been considered one of the most premiere Pro machines you could get for engineers, designers, musicians and more, but that was then and this is now. While the MacBook Pro is still a very capable machine, there are many other Windows 10 laptops that are really worth looking at even for pro users. I honestly would have looked at the Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base or the newer Dell XPS 15″ that is slated for Q1 2017. The only reason I ended up pulling the trigger on this machine is because of the large amount of money I had in Apple Store gift cards. Apple Store gift cards are not redeemable for cash so I ended up paying for the majority of this machine using those. Had I had cash in hand, I would have most certainly checked out the Windows 10 offerings. This MacBook Pro is most certainly an upgrade from my 2011 MacBook Pro so I’m not complaining in that regard. Overall, I still love the new 2016 15″ MacBook Pro. I don’t think it’s worth the money they’re charging for it when there are equal or even better alternatives on the market but it is a very capable and good machine. If you’re in the market for a new laptop and are looking at this laptop, I’d encourage you to shop around and see if there is a Windows 10 alternative that may suit your needs, but even if you don’t, the MacBook Pro is still a good machine — unless Apple doesn’t find a way to fix the battery life problem. +111 Tweet Share1 Share1 Stumble Pin Related Items:Apple, featured, Laptops, MacBook Pro, Surface Book, technology, Windows 10 Recommended for you Official Google+ Android community overrun by porn and no moderation Apple iPhone production will be cut in first quarter of 2017 HAP2U technology wants to bring you a new touch interface experience Comments Lenovo at CES 2017 Our Top Review Picks See Fewer Ads Latest Tech News 19 Android / Mobile / Tech ASUS ZenFone AR leaked ahead of CES 2017 107 Hardware Reviews / Reviews / Tech Lenovo Yoga 910 review: A high quality, great performing ultrabook with average battery life 522 Editorial / Google / Tech Official Google+ Android community overrun by porn and no moderation Latest Reviews 107 Hardware Reviews / Reviews / Tech Lenovo Yoga 910 review: A high quality, great performing ultrabook with average battery life 74 Hardware Reviews / Reviews / Tech Vuzix iWear Video Headphones review: Immerse yourself in the view 129 Android / Audio / Editorial / Gaming / Gaming Hardware / Mobile / Reviews / Tech / Top Picks Here are my favourite “Top Picks of 2016” Apple boots Nokia owned Withings products from their shelves The Gionee M2017 is up for pre-orders in China About Techaeris Techaeris was founded in 2013 by Alex Hernandez and covers a spectrum of information related to technology, gaming, entertainment, science, art, photography and life.

Though this movie certainly has its own issues, which I’ll get into later, my greater frustration is that it continues the trend of video game movies falling flat. As someone who has spent most his life playing video games, it pains me to keep seeing my favorite franchises have their reputations smeared on the silver screen. Every release, from Tomb Raider to Mortal Kombat, has been a regular disappointment. I’d say the Resident Evil franchise has made waves but despite getting the green light for a total of five sequels its films get torn apart by critics and fans alike. For you to understand my issue with this movie I have to explain the plots on which it is based. Assassin’s Creed loosely follows and condenses the complicated story of the first three games in the franchise: Assassin’s Creed I, II and Brotherhood. Warning: video game and, to a lesser extent, movie spoilers ahead! Leaderboard 1 <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=74458bb90a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538220187&cs=74458bb90a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=8cd4e36b59&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873873&cs=8cd4e36b59&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> All three games center on Desmond Miles, a modern-day descendant of master assassins Altair Ibn La’Ahad and Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Both Altair and Ezio were key members of an ancient organization known as the Assassin’s Creed, which sought to protect the innocent. In the present day, Desmond is forcefully employed by the Abstergo Corporation, a front for the Knights Templar — the ever-present nemesis of the Assassins, to retrace his ancestor’s steps. Abstergo uses a machine called the Animus that allows Desmond to relive his ancestors’ genetic memories. The corporation hopes to retrace the Assassins’ steps to reveal where the Assassins hid the Apple of Eden, which can be used to enslave humanity by destroying free will. In the present day, Desmond begins to hallucinate as the line between his ancestors’ pasts and his own reality blurs. Due to his prolonged time in the Animus, this “Bleeding Effect” activates Desmond’s Eagle Vision, a sixth sense mastered by the Assassins. As he unearths more of the truth, Desmond goes rogue and uses his newly found Eagle Vision to acquire the Apple for himself, thus saving humanity from the Templars. In the film, Callum Lynch, played by Fassbender, shares blood with Aguilar de Nerha, an Assassin during the Spanish Inquisition. Side-note: águila means “eagle” in Spanish… easy does it with the symbolism guys. Lynch is revived after his own execution by the Abstergo Corporation, headed by Dr. Sofia Rikkin and her father — played by Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons, to be used in their Animus program. In the movie’s universe, the Templars have traced the Apple of Eden all the way through history to Águilar and hope to discover its present location by finding out where he hid it. If you’re not a fan of the games all of that probably seemed a bit confusing, but in the games where the story can be revealed over the course of hours and hours it all makes good sense. The player is given time to digest the plot and become invested in the characters. The film’s 115-minute runtime robs the viewer of this luxury and squanders every character arc but those of Lynch and Rikkin. Potentially intriguing characters like Moussa, another of Abstergo’s kidnapped Assassin-descendants, and Maria, Águilar’s will-they-won’t-they Assassin cohort, receive so little screen time that the audience can’t even begin to relate to them. Leaderboard 2 <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538220188&cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> I suspect that some executive at 20th Century Fox saw the successes of sequel-driven franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a video game series with 13 entries and put the film on course for a sequel that will likely never see the light of day. This approach led the director, Justin Kurzel, to focus heavily on Lynch’s actions in the present day instead of Águilar’s actions. This is the downfall of the film. The studio was so concerned with setting up Fassbender’s character for the future that they neglected to deliver on it in the present. What I as a long-time fan so desperately wanted to see was a film that forgets about Abstergo and the Animus. Cinematic releases simply don’t have the time to make such complex concepts work! Give me Assassin’s Creed: Águilar: the story of an Assassin fighting for what’s right against overwhelming odds during the Spanish Inquisition; let me fall in love with Maria and the other Assassins. There would be no problem hiking up the stakes around the fight for the Apple in the past because the Templars were seeking the same goal then as they were in the present. What upset me so much about this film is that it gave me glimpses into the movie I so desired and repeatedly ripped me away from it. This film even messed up the fast-paced sequences from Águilar’s point of view. The outstanding action is absolutely cut to pieces. Every stunt is seemingly shown from every perspective, jarring the audience and often cutting away from anything that might have raised red flags for a PG-13 movie. The film’s rating is another mistake. Every main entry in the video game franchise is rated M, meaning players must be 17 to purchase them for themselves, and depicts jaw-dropping violence and brutal assassinations. Taking this away from the franchise is clipping the eagle’s wings. The acting is solid — Fassbender and crew seem to do the best they can with what they’re given. I’d even call the script adequate given the sheer volume of material it tried to cram into two hours and despite my reservations about the editing of the action scenes, it was a thrill to see the Assassin’s fighting style on the big screen. Still, Assassin’s Creed is a film plagued by a studio’s desire to make money on a sequel. Until a studio has the fortitude to make a video game movie for the sake of making a good movie, they’re all doomed to this brand of disappointing mediocrity. Rating: four out of 10 Hidden Blades.

Related The (Dim) Light Between Oceans By Elyes Benantar September 8, 2016 There’s a scene early on in The Light Between Oceans where Alicia Vikander’s character speaks of a mother and father still being referred to as such even after they no longer have a child, and she states that she feels like a sister even after losing siblings of her own. Moments such as these tease the potential for interesting themes and ideas to be played out in the film. Stardew Valley: Pushing The Boundaries of Farming RPGs By Amy Lin February 23, 2016 Imagine merging the game mechanics of Terraria and the flexibility of Harvest Moon, and you will come close to envisioning Eric Barone’s new “country-life RPG,” Stardew Valley, the culmination of four years of development. In the game, the player inherits his late grandfather’s farm — sound familiar, Harvest Moon fans? Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Twitter Facebook Nokia and Apple trade accusations in patent lawsuits The companies are at odds over fair licensing of the H.264 video codec and other technologies Grant Gross (IDG News Service) 22 December, 2016 08:24 - - - - print email Comments An international patent dispute has broken out between Apple and Nokia over the Finnish mobile network vendor's licensing terms for the widely used H.264 video codec and other technologies. Nokia on Wednesday filed lawsuits against Apple in Germany and in the U.S., alleging that the smartphone giant has infringed 32 of its patents. Nokia's five lawsuits follow an Apple lawsuit filed in California Tuesday. The U.S. company accused Nokia of working with patent assertion firms Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management to "extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly and anticompetitively" from Apple and other smartphone makers. Nokia was not named as one of eight defendants in the Apple lawsuit. Nokia's patent infringement lawsuits, filed with the Regional Courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich in Germany and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, cover patents related to displays, user interfaces, software, antennas, chipsets, and video coding, Nokia said Wednesday. Nokia is planning to file more lawsuits in other jurisdictions, the company said in a press release. The eight patents covered in one of Nokia's Texas lawsuits, filed Wednesday, are related to the H.264 Advanced Video Coding standard approved by the International Telecommunication Union, according to Nokia's complaint. A second Texas lawsuit covers 10 patents for a range of other technologies. Apple products using the H.264 video codec include the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, Macs, and Apple TV, Nokia said in its complaint. "Despite all the advantages that have been enjoyed by Apple, Apple has steadfastly refused to agree to license Nokia's H.264 patents on reasonable terms," Nokia's lawyers wrote. "Dozens of companies have licensed Nokia’s patents for use in their products ... Apple, however, refuses to pay Nokia's established royalty rates." Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the lawsuits. As part of the ITU standards process, Nokia agreed to grant licenses for the H.264 decoder on reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or RAND, terms, the company said. However, the ITU standard covers only the decoder, and not the encoder, the complaint said. Nokia has offered Apple a license for the encoder technology on RAND terms, but Apple has refused to pay, the company asserted. "Nokia has negotiated in good faith and made substantial efforts to enter into a license agreement with Apple on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms," its lawyers wrote. Nokia research has contributed to "fundamental technologies" used in Apple products, Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Patent Business at Nokia, said in a press release. "After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights." Apple's lawsuit, meanwhile, alleges that Nokia is working with outside patent assertion firms to skirt its RAND patent commitments to standards bodies. Nokia promised it would "license its patents fairly," Apple's lawyers wrote. Nokia is working with the patent lawsuit filers on a "scheme to diffuse and abuse" the company's patents by extracting "exorbitant" royalties, they alleged in their complaint. Nokia's aggressive patent licensing efforts came after the company largely exited the smartphone-making business, Apple's lawyers wrote. "Unable to compete with innovative companies such as Apple -- which had developed a revolutionary hardware and software platform -- Nokia quickly transformed itself," Apple's lawyers wrote. "It changed from a company focused on supplying cell phones and other consumer products to a company bent on exploiting the patents that remain from its years as a successful cell phone supplier." Acacia and Conversant didn't immediately respond to requests for comments on the Apple lawsuit. The Apple lawsuit is "unrelated to our own complaints" against the company, a Nokia spokesman said by email. "By failing to agree to terms, Apple is seeking an unfair advantage over our other licensees and we are taking steps to protect our inventions and defend our rights," he added.

Twitter Facebook Nokia files even more patent lawsuits against Apple Nokia accuses Apple of infringing 40 patents in lawsuits filed in 11 countries Grant Gross (IDG News Service) 23 December, 2016 05:47 - - - - print email Comments Nokia has filed new patent infringement lawsuits against Apple on Thursday, a day after it weighed in on a licensing dispute with the company by filing claims in Germany and the U.S. On Wednesday, the Finland-based mobile network vendor filed lawsuits in three German courts and two lawsuits in a Texas court, leveling infringement claims against Apple on the widely used H.264 video codec and other technologies. Those suits cover 32 of Nokia's patents. Nokia's first round of lawsuits came after Apple filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Nokia of working with patent assertion firms Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management to “extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly and anticompetitively” from Apple and other smartphone makers.  On Thursday, Nokia announced new lawsuits against Apple, with 40 patents covered in the claims filed this week. The company's new lawsuits were filed in Finland, the U.K., Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Hong Kong, and Japan. In addition, Nokia has filed a complaint against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission, which has the power to bar the importation of products to the U.S. if they are found to infringe patents. The USITC complaint covers eight patents. Some of the disputes revolve around promises by Nokia to license some H.264 technologies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory (RAND) terms. Nokia has accused Apple of refusing to negotiate for licenses for some H.264 technologies, while Apple has accused Nokia of violating RAND promises. Apple products using the H.264 video codec include the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, Macs, and Apple TV, Nokia said in a complaint filed Wednesday in Texas. Other Nokia patents in the lawsuits are related to displays, user interfaces, software, antennas, and chipsets.

The one prediction for the outgoing year that did come to pass was the migration of streaming video channels into the consumer mainstream, fuelled by successes like Jeremy Clarkson’s Grand Tour on Amazon Prime, and Peter Morgan’s drama about our post-war monarchy, The Crown, on Netflix. The production values of both these series easily outstrip anything the BBC could have afforded and undermines, more than somewhat, the corporation’s argument for the retention of the TV licence fee. But while a wholesale refinancing of the BBC is not on anyone’s roadmap for 2017, a few other trends are already starting to emerge... Death of the smartwatch: They were supposed to be the next big thing, and Apple’s entry into the “wearables” market in 2015 seemed to lend an air of permanence to the whole enterprise. But it was always obvious that smartwatches were less useful than the phones - and as a result, neither the Apple Watch nor Google’s Android Wear sold in sufficient numbers. The disappearance of the pioneer Pebble Watch brand following the company’s sale to a maker of fitness tracking bands, was the final nail in the coffin. Doubling down on security: Two months ago, hackers managed to take down some of the world’s most popular websites for nearly 24 hours. But they didn’t need to penetrate the sites themselves - they simply hijacked unprotected security cameras, video recorders and other devices connected to what has become known as the Internet of Things - thereby throttling the bandwidth available to everything else You have probably lost count of the gadgets in your own house and garage that connect to the net, and it’s a fair bet that none of them, unless they are conventional PCs, have any sort of security software installed. That will start to change in 2017, but you can strike it off your own to-do list - it will be down to manufacturers, not consumers, to implement. Talking into our phones: A decade ago, you couldn’t get on a train without hearing someone shout, “I’m going into a tunnel” into his mobile at the top of his voice - but texts and social media have supplanted traditional voice calls for many of us, and turned using a mobile phone into a more solitary experience. That will change as Google, Apple and Amazon all escalate their “personal assistant” services - which will mean that very soon it will be the norm to shout, rather than type search terms into our handsets. Connected living: Amazon’s Echo range of “smart switches” for the home has gained enormous traction during the last few months, thanks to vastly reduced prices. These let you control your hi-fi, TV, lights, and other connected devices by - again - shouting at them from your sofa. But they will face competition in 2017 from Apple Home and Google Home, each with a range of compatible products. The best will control your central heating, too. And finally… President Trump: Neither Old Moore nor I can accurately interrogate our almanacs for the likely outcome of this development… but whatever happens, it’s a safe bet that we will hear about it first on a fake news site or on Twitter.

Patrick Thibodeau (Computerworld (US)) 22 December, 2016 21:58 - - - - print email Comments The Electronic Frontier Foundation is keenly worried that President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress will step up surveillance activities and pass laws to curtail electronic rights. As a result, the EFF is advising the tech sector to use end-to-end encryption for every transaction by default, and to scrub logs. "You cannot be made to surrender data you do not have," the EFF said. "We need to start securing our systems now," said Rainey Reitman, director of the EFF's activism team, in an interview. "If we wait until he [Trump] starts putting overbroad government demands on tech companies, they won't have the time to clean up their logs and encrypt data." "It's very clear to us that he is no friend to civil liberties," said Reitman, of Trump. "He will be in a position where he can move bills and support measures and even put out executive orders that can be very detrimental to digital rights." The tech community is wary, generally, of Trump. More than 1,000 people who work at tech firms have signed a pledge, Neveragain.tech , not to help the incoming administration create a database to target people because of race or religion or to facilitate mass deportations. The EFF has assembled evidence it believes justifies this call for action. That includes Trump's call for forcing Apple to open the iPhone owned by one the San Bernardino attackers. The government wanted Apple to hack into the iPhone, something it would not do. Trump's response to Apple was, "Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it up." The FBI ultimately unlocked the phone with help of a third party. Legislation also emerged to broadly compel the tech industry to provide a backdoor to encrypted communications, notably in an effort by Senators Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Senate Intelligence Committee. But the White House didn't support it at the time. Reitman believes the encryption issue will emerge again, and a Trump White House may approve backdoor legislation. This "is one of the things to watch out for over the next few months," she said. Many of the big vendors also have large contracts with the government and are seeking pro-industry trade agreements as well. But the industry has also received pushback from its users, particularly in the wake of revelations by Edward Snowden that the government was participating in surveillance efforts. Because of Snowden, "tech actually had to show that they were willing to fight for individual users and were willing to take steps to improve privacy," said Reitman. The EFF has outlined a set of specific recommendations it believes tech firms can take. Some are aimed at specific firms, such as calling on Twitter to enable end-to-end encrypted direct messages. The data the Trump administration could use to track certain groups is already available. Businesses, Facebook being the obvious example, may have databases with details about the religious and ethnic backgrounds of their customers, Reitman said. The effort by some in Silicon Valley to speak out against and fight any effort by tech firms to participate in this data collection will also be up against government contracting. "The Trump administration will always be able to find contractors that are willing to do most anything short of illegal, provided the potential liabilities are realistic," said Ray Bjorklund, who heads federal market research firm BirchGrove Consulting. The government can issue new orders on existing contracts, although terms and conditions can be set that protect both parties, said Bjorklund. The government could also re-open the business for other bidders, he said. Even without the EFF raising its own concerns, the Neveragain.tech effort points to use of data gathering in the Holocaust to illustrate the gravity of the issue. Christopher Browning, a Holocaust researcher who wrote a number of books, said that in many countries, particularly eastern Europe, the Nazis relied on local collaborators to identify local Jews. But in western Europe, especially The Netherlands, "registration of Jews was a key, seemingly innocent, but in retrospect fatal step that made it virtually impossible for those who did register to escape all further measures" short of attempted hiding, he said, in an email response to questions. "In The Netherlands forged papers were particularly difficult, due to the very advanced technology of the bureaucracy in producing ID papers," said Browning. "In contrast, in Athens the ability of the Jewish community to destroy all of its records before the Germans arrived made it very difficult for the Germans to find and identify Jews in southern Greece. Those on the islands, however, were for all practical purposes trapped and thus suffered a much higher fatality rate than those on the southern mainland." "Given that any intensified persecution of minorities in the U.S. would more likely follow the western European rather than eastern European model, then yes, registration is a key, endangering factor," said Browning. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 21 December, 2016 20:00 - - - - print email Comments Microsoft claims that more people are switching to Surface devices from Macs than ever before. That's a concept that would have been hard to picture when Microsoft first released the Microsoft Surface RT and Surface Pro in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The Surface RT suffered from a watered-down version of the new -- and generally disliked -- Windows 8 operating system and, while the Surface Pro featured the full desktop version, it came with hardware limitations and a high price tag. In a sea of clam shell notebooks, all vying to be thinner and lighter than the last, the Surface clumsily debuted as a confusing mashup of a tablet and a laptop. And people didn't like it. RT users complained of the limited functionality and never-ending bugs, while Surface Pro users were forced to pay a high price just to avoid Windows RT. In fact, the Surface RT did so poorly that Microsoft had to take a $900 million dollar write-down after drastically cutting the price of the device. The backlash even made some question whether or not we were witnessing the end of Microsoft. It might seem dramatic now in 2016, but in 2013, people really missed the Start menu. Instead, Microsoft listened to consumers' complaints to find a balance between the company's vision and what consumers wanted. And it worked -- Microsoft has regained credibility and popularity by creating new products that didn't simply mimic or improve upon what was already out there. [ Related story: Macbook Pro vs Surface Book i7 ] Apple's identity crisis For a company once targeting modern, creative professionals, it's hard to tell who Apple makes products for anymore. Apple's devices now feel tailored to a low-tech crowd, or people who like new tech, but just aren't that interested in specs. They want a reliable, easy-to-use device that just works. But where does that leave the original fan base of creative workers who need high-performance and cutting edge features? Apple hasn't left this industry with many options -- and at this point, you can get more for your money in graphics and performance on a Surface Book than a Macbook Pro. Plus, with the newly announced Microsoft Studio, there is finally a strong alternative to the iMac -- with a touch display, no less. Apple's compromise is the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which features a dynamic touch bar replacing the row of function keys on the keyboard. The display changes depending on settings and the app you're using; it's a cool feature, and certainly useful, but it's a confusing message. If the iPad Pro is competing with hybrid notebooks like the Surface Pro 4, but Apple doesn't think people want touch-displays on a notebook, then does that make the iPad Pro a giant iPad? Microsoft is focused on touch-based input -- in fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find even a mid-ranged PC that doesn't at least offer the option of an upgrade to a touch display. The two companies have taken different stances, but in siding with touch, Microsoft has more to offer in each of its devices. If you want a notebook that can sometimes be a tablet, or a tablet that can sometimes be a notebook, you can purchase just one device instead of two. Microsoft has focused on developing a family of Surface devices that can suit a wide range of users. It starts with the lower-end Surface 3, which is a great device for anyone who just wants a computer to surf the web and use basic apps. The Surface Pro 4 acts as a step up in size and hardware, with configurations for anyone from light users to those who need more performance. And now, with the Surface Book and Surface Studio, even those who need the highest end configurations for heavy-duty video or image editing have an option. [ Related story: History of Apple and Microsoft: 4 decades of peaks and valleys ] The Surface in pop culture Remember when Windows users were the boring, out of touch, suit-wearing nerds in commercials, and a Mac user was the hipster CEO of a startup -- that guy in 2006 who wore hoodies and scootered to all his meetings? That landscape has changed a lot since then, and now Microsoft is the one calling out Apple on selling outdated hardware and falling behind the curve. Microsoft has clearly made a push to get the Surface in front of consumers anyway possible -- CNN commentators used the devices in this year's debates, but it was later discovered they were using them to hide their iPads. Hulu's The Mindy Project also features Mindy Kaling's character using a Surface Book, with one very obvious instance of product marketing, where she very purposefully ejects the display from the keyboard. And what New Englander can forget when the Surface Pro 4 made headlines after Patriot's coach, Bill Belichick, became so frustrated with the technology that he spiked it onto the field. These might not be the most positive representations of the brand, but the visibility of the device seems to be working. In places where it used to be a sea of aluminum notebooks, featuring the familiar, backlit Apple logo, we're starting to see some diversity. Just as it wasn't the end of Microsoft in 2013, it's now Apple's chance to step out of the spotlight and make some changes. But there's nothing like a little healthy competition to help spark new, creative designs and that's exactly what motivated Microsoft to step back, refocus and come back strong.

Twitter Facebook Nokia files even more patent lawsuits against Apple Nokia accuses Apple of infringing 40 patents in lawsuits filed in 11 countries Grant Gross (IDG News Service) 23 December, 2016 05:47 - - - - print email Comments Nokia has filed new patent infringement lawsuits against Apple on Thursday, a day after it weighed in on a licensing dispute with the company by filing claims in Germany and the U.S. On Wednesday, the Finland-based mobile network vendor filed lawsuits in three German courts and two lawsuits in a Texas court, leveling infringement claims against Apple on the widely used H.264 video codec and other technologies. Those suits cover 32 of Nokia's patents. Nokia's first round of lawsuits came after Apple filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Nokia of working with patent assertion firms Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management to “extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly and anticompetitively” from Apple and other smartphone makers.  On Thursday, Nokia announced new lawsuits against Apple, with 40 patents covered in the claims filed this week. The company's new lawsuits were filed in Finland, the U.K., Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Hong Kong, and Japan. In addition, Nokia has filed a complaint against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission, which has the power to bar the importation of products to the U.S. if they are found to infringe patents. The USITC complaint covers eight patents. Some of the disputes revolve around promises by Nokia to license some H.264 technologies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory (RAND) terms. Nokia has accused Apple of refusing to negotiate for licenses for some H.264 technologies, while Apple has accused Nokia of violating RAND promises. Apple products using the H.264 video codec include the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, Macs, and Apple TV, Nokia said in a complaint filed Wednesday in Texas. Other Nokia patents in the lawsuits are related to displays, user interfaces, software, antennas, and chipsets.

The decision could affect CIOs and mobile administrators. Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 24 December, 2016 02:27 - - - - print email Comments When Apple in July announced it would require all iOS apps to use a technology called "App Transport Security" by the start of 2017, the move was widely regarded as a positive one for user privacy. Now, just barely a week before the deadline, Apple pulled back and extended the deadline indefinitely. The requirement, if implemented, would fill a significant security hole on iOS devices, according to experts.  Apple takes a strong and public position in favor of protecting its users' privacy. The highest profile example of this is perhaps the company's standoff in January with the FBI over its insistence that data be encrypted on iOS devices at rest, regardless of the owner or reasons for a government's requests to override those protections. (In that case, the intelligence agency wanted access to an alleged terrorist's personal device to scrape it for evidence and other information). What is App Transport Security? App Transport Security requires mobile apps to encrypt data in transit using HTTPS, thereby encrypting all data that is transported across the network via iOS devices, according to Robbie Forkish, vice president of engineering at Appthority, a mobile risk analysis firm that also sells assessment services for mobile devices, apps and APIs.  "To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed," Apple wrote Wednesday evening in a brief note to developers. The company originally introduced App Transport Security in iOS 9 in September 2015 but uptake has been tepid. Appthority earlier this month concluded in a report that just 3 percent of the top 200 iOS apps installed on enterprise devices worldwide meet Apple's security mandate. During the three weeks since that research was published, four additional apps added support for App Transport Security. "That takes the percentage from 3 percent to 5 percent," Forkish says. "Obviously there's a huge gap between having all the apps comply."  Why Apple wants stronger iOS app encryption Apple is pushing for the security tech to be adopted throughout the app ecosystem, following a trend that began a few years ago when HTTPS became the default in browsers, according to Forkish. "An increasing number of percentages across the web are now fully encrypted end to end," he says. "There's this gap where the majority of apps, in communicating with their backend servers, do so unencrypted. That kind of stands out now as an insecure part of the overall ecosystem." [Related: CIOs assess how Apple and Google approach enterprise apps] Enterprises should be concerned about this gap in security, and CIOs who have relied on Apple to provide necessary security are realizing that strategy is no longer viable, if it ever was, according to Forkish. CIOs need to be aware of the apps that don't support App Transport Security and seek out alternatives that provide the same productivity functions but in a more secure manner, he says. "It's hard to know why developers did not meet this deadline. There certainly was adequate time," he says. "The fact that they haven't announced a new date suggests to me that it's probably not in the next six months."  Forkish speculates that one of the problems could be a lack of security skills among iOS developers, who are more likely pressured to focus on time-to-market, size of the addressable market and quantifying the features of their apps compared to competitors' offerings. "Security may not be a concept that app developers, by and large, are familiar with," he says. "It wasn't an oppressive development challenge to implement App Transport Security." With no further explanation from Apple, the extension should also give enterprises cause for concern, according to Forkish. CIOs need to better understand how apps come to be in enterprise environments, as well as the different participants involved, he says. "A lot of CIOs are thinking more in terms of trust than just security, and if you can't trust that supply chain for your global apps then you really need to take steps to make sure you know how to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak."

The company had previously announced at its Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June that all apps submitted to the App Store will need support the App Transport Security (ATS) feature starting January 1st, 2017. It has not yet set a new deadline. ATS is a feature first introduced in iOS 9 that forces apps to communicate with internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections. It's an improvement over the third-party frameworks that developers previously used to implement HTTPS because it ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers are used. Even if ATS is enabled by default in iOS, on a technical level app developers can disable some of its features or can opt out of it entirely through various exception settings that ATS makes available. A recent study performed by security firm Appthority on the top 200 apps present on iOS enterprise devices showed that 97 percent of them bypassed at least some ATS requirements and weakened the default and recommended configuration. Apple planned to include ATS compliance as a requirement in its App Store review process starting next year and to require reasonable justifications for any exceptions. However, as the Appthority study showed, many developers are unprepared to fully enable ATS in their apps. "At WWDC 2016 we announced that apps submitted to the App Store will be required to support ATS at the end of the year," Apple said in an announcement on its developer site Wednesday. "To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed." There are many reasons why developers might not be ready or even able to encrypt all of their apps' traffic. For example, many apps integrate with third-party advertising, analytics and media hosting services and the adoption of HTTPS by those services is not something that app developers can control. As of December 22, the 3 percent ATS readiness figure among iOS apps had grown to only 5 percent, the Appthority researchers said Thursday in a blog post. "We assume that Apple, too, realized that an unacceptably high number of apps would fail to meet the ATS deadline unless it was extended." The researchers believe that even if Apple hasn't abandoned its plans for full ATS compliance, this is not something that can be achieved very soon, which is probably why a new deadline hasn't been announced yet. "In light of this new development, we recommend that enterprises track the state of apps’ ATS compliance and consider alternatives to apps that access sensitive corporate data and don’t secure their network connections using ATS," they said. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Call them marriages of necessity, but Apple is striking corporate deals that make it more friendly to CIOs. We look at five of those partnerships. Clint Boulton (CIO (US)) 20 December, 2016 02:44 - - - - print email Comments The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs Apple was notorious for taking a hard line against enterprises, which he suggested were bureaucracies who (do we say who in reference to a business?) struggled to make decisions. The reticence to play nice with enterprises didn't endear Apple to CIOs, who need to manage fleets of iPhones and iPads. "Apple has never, at least until recently, embraced corporations and embraced the enterprise," Stuart Appley, former CIO of Shorenstein, told CIO.com in 2015. "They're a consumer-first company." That began to change in 2011 under new CEO Tim Cook, who has been praised for his willingness to work with corporations. Ironically, Apple's success with consumers in the mobile device market make their manageability in the enterprise so vital today, as the iPhone and iPad almost single-handedly spurred consumerization. Employees have forced companies to initiate bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies. [ Related: CIOs assess how Apple and Google approach enterprise apps ] With these consumers/employees holding onto phones and tablets for several years rather than refreshing them every time a new device launches, Apple is "feeling the heat on sales" and must cut deals with vendors to improve its penetration with corporate customers, says Jack Gold, founder of J. Gold Associates research firm. "Apple didn't drive it, they were pulled along and faced bigger pressure to do the deals," Gold says. [ Related: Apple predicts growth in near term despite down year ] Gold says software makers and solution providers struggling with BYOD have increased the pressure on Apple to make their software run better on iOS devices. Apple, in turn, can no longer afford to remain aloof to the overtures from enterprise vendors. Call it a marriage of necessity. "It's being forced on them by enterprises who require security and manageability," Gold says. CIO.com highlights the corporate deals that are making Apple more friendly to CIOs who required simplified management solutions. IBM Apple-IBM In a landmark mobility deal, Apple in 2014 agreed to work with IBM cloud and analytics software ran on iPhones and iPads. While some initially derided this as a vaporware deal designed to grab headlines, the companies proved pundits wrong over the next 18 months, releasing 100 iOS apps for industries such as financial services, energy and retail. Gold says the deal epitomizes how "democratization," or consumerization has forced enterprises to do what their customers wanted for a change. Cisco Apple-Cisco Underscoring how Apple's enterprise deals had begun to pay off, CEO Cook said during an October 2015 earnings call that the enterprise market was generating $25 billion in revenue for the company, up 40 percent over the same period last year. Emboldened by this success, Apple accelerated its corporate deal-making, inking agreements with Box, ServiceMax and DocuSign. In December 2015, Cook joined Cisco Systems Executive Chairman John Chambers on stage at a Cisco conference to announce that the two companies would partner to enable enterprises to give their most important iOS apps priority. The true nature of the deal was revealed in September, in which iOS 10 was integrated with an updated version of Cisco's Wi-Fi router protocols to let businesses prioritize enterprise traffic, business apps and communications on corporate iOS devices. More than 30 customers, including telecommunications firms BT Group, Deutsche Telecom and KDDI, tested the enhanced Cisco capabilities in early field trials. SAP Apple-SAP In May 2016, Apple and SAP unveiled a wide-ranging deal to develop more native iOS apps, as well as an SDK for SAP's HANA cloud platform, together. The agreement also includes a plan to establish a new "SAP Academy for iOS," where SAP customers and partners can meet to design apps for iPhones and iPads and received training. Apple CEO Tim Cook praised SAP and called it a leader in enterprise software. "With 76 percent of business transactions touching an SAP system, SAP is the ideal partner to help us truly transform how businesses around the world are run on iPhone and iPad," Cook said. Deloitte Apple Apple teamed up with Deloitte in September in what could be Apple's biggest enterprise pact since IBM. Deloitte agreed to create a consultancy comprising more than 5,000 strategic advisors, including iOS architects, developers and designers, to help businesses improve operations in retail, field services, recruiting, research and development, supply chain management and back-office systems. Apple Device Enrollment Program Apple While IT administrators have been able to centrally configure and monitor iPhones and iPads using third-party mobile device management products since the release of iOS 4, they still had to enroll their devices with Apple and then activate workplace mobile device management themselves. Finally recognizing that managing fleets of Apple devices was a chore for CIOs, Apple in 2014 rolled out the Device Enrollment Program, which allows IT pros to automate deployment of iOS and OS X devices with preset MDM configurations. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Twitter Facebook Apple gives iOS app developers more time to encrypt communications The iOS App Transport Security (ATS) will not become a requirement on Jan. 1, as previously announced Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 24 December, 2016 00:25 - - - - print email Comments Apple has backtracked on a plan to force iOS developers to encrypt their app communications by the end of the year. The company had previously announced at its Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June that all apps submitted to the App Store will need support the App Transport Security (ATS) feature starting January 1st, 2017. It has not yet set a new deadline. ATS is a feature first introduced in iOS 9 that forces apps to communicate with internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections. It's an improvement over the third-party frameworks that developers previously used to implement HTTPS because it ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers are used. Even if ATS is enabled by default in iOS, on a technical level app developers can disable some of its features or can opt out of it entirely through various exception settings that ATS makes available. A recent study performed by security firm Appthority on the top 200 apps present on iOS enterprise devices showed that 97 percent of them bypassed at least some ATS requirements and weakened the default and recommended configuration. Apple planned to include ATS compliance as a requirement in its App Store review process starting next year and to require reasonable justifications for any exceptions. However, as the Appthority study showed, many developers are unprepared to fully enable ATS in their apps. "At WWDC 2016 we announced that apps submitted to the App Store will be required to support ATS at the end of the year," Apple said in an announcement on its developer site Wednesday. "To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed." There are many reasons why developers might not be ready or even able to encrypt all of their apps' traffic. For example, many apps integrate with third-party advertising, analytics and media hosting services and the adoption of HTTPS by those services is not something that app developers can control. As of December 22, the 3 percent ATS readiness figure among iOS apps had grown to only 5 percent, the Appthority researchers said Thursday in a blog post. "We assume that Apple, too, realized that an unacceptably high number of apps would fail to meet the ATS deadline unless it was extended." The researchers believe that even if Apple hasn't abandoned its plans for full ATS compliance, this is not something that can be achieved very soon, which is probably why a new deadline hasn't been announced yet. "In light of this new development, we recommend that enterprises track the state of apps’ ATS compliance and consider alternatives to apps that access sensitive corporate data and don’t secure their network connections using ATS," they said.

Thaivisa.com Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn 2016 has been a watershed year for technology. There has been some spectacular fails that have brought a more realistic perspective to the fundamental belief that technology improves with time. In part, this is because we have now pushed hardware and software to its limits, and certainly beyond our ability to guarantee that it will work as promised, or even secretly hoped. 2016 was the year that technology hit a wall, with significant challenges that will need to be overcome before it can pick up again and start to bring any of its promised future benefits. When batteries fail This was certainly the case with batteries, as Samsung was forced to abandon an entire product, the Galaxy Note 7 because of faulty batteries that spontaneously caught fire. In the end, the problems with the batteries were brought about because of the drive to each year produce new model phones that are thinner and have greater battery life. With each cycle, the engineering challenge becomes greater and the margin of error smaller. Samsung just happened to push beyond that point this year and it ended up costing them around US $3 billion with untold damage to its brand. Samsung were not the only phone company with battery problems however. Apple has had ongoing battery issues where iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S models of iPhone abruptly shut down with the battery percentage still showing anywhere from 30% to 50%. Apple maintained that the problem affected only a small number of iPhones and offered a limited replacement but has now admitted that the problem is more widespread than it first thought. Battery issues are not confined to mobile phones however. Apple’s new MacBook Pro has failed to be endorsed by the US Consumer Reports because its battery life was so erratic in tests that the consumer organisation was not able to determine what a reasonable consumer expectation would be for the product. In a set of tests of the 13-inch TouchBar model, Consumer Reports found that battery life varied from 19.5 hours to 4.5 hours. This mirrored what MacBook owners themselves were finding. Apple has now acknowledged the issue and is working with Consumer Reports to replicate its tests. Toxic Twitter and Facebook fake news 2016 was also the year where the world realised that social networks were not only not infallible but also suffering from problems so systemic that it has rendered them almost toxic. Twitter failed to find a buyer this year basically because of its reputation as being a haven for bullies, trolls, racists and misoginysts. The fact that Donald Trump and his followers found their element in Twitter only seemed to confirm this. Twitter’s troll problem dwarfed its other fundamental issue which was that it still hasn’t worked out how to make any money. Facebook and Twitter became the principle purveyors of fake news during the US election and like Apple and Samsung with their battery issues, eventually “‘fessed up” to the fact that it had it was responsible for this new, and socially damaging, phenomenon. Facebook was trying to stave off admitting that it was responsible because it now has to find a solution and it is really not clear that there is one. This was the year in which Yahoo proved once and for all that it really didn’t care about its customers’ security in admitting that it had been hacked at least twice and lost details of 1 billion accounts to unknown hackers. Yahoo insiders talked of a culture that refused to properly fund security in the period before the hacks happened. The hacks may be enough to jeopardise Yahoo’s sale to Verizon, or at least shave billions off the already low price. Nazi AI Artificial Intelligence proved this year that it is a way off from dooming humanity as Microsoft unleashed a chat bot Tay that quickly became offensive, sending out racist, Nazi and anti-feminist tweets. Of course, one could argue that the chat bot was simply adapting to its Twitter environment but as the point was produce an AI with real intelligence, the experiment failed. 2016 was the year chat bots were due to be the next big thing in customer engagement but Microsoft illustrated quite dramatically the limitations of the technology. When things attack Probably the biggest wake-up call of 2016 was the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that succeeded in bringing down a large part of the Internet. The DDoS attack was launched from large numbers of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices which have been rushed to market with poor to non-existent security. As the number of these devices is already in the billions, the risks that compromised devices may pose is only really becoming fully appreciated. The list doesn’t end there of course. The US election was hacked by Russia, the Australian government proved it couldn’t run a website to conduct the census, and the movie industry continued to believe that spending money on ineffective blocks of torrent sites was better than making good movies universally available to customers. We can only hope that 2017 proves a better year for tech.

But that’s not saying much. These kind of adaptations have become a common talking point in relation to the worst films of all time. Studios want to adapt video games because they’re quickly becoming the most marketable and highest grossing entertainment industry. But films haven’t been able to capture the fun or the weight of video games, despite trying for the past 30 years. Try to watch “Doom,” “Hitman: Agent 47” or the absolutely dreadful “Super Mario Bros.” without thinking “I would rather be playing the game.” It’s impossible. Despite this curse on video game adaptations, “Assassin’s Creed” was supposed to be the film to change those sentiments. The film managed to get an up-and-coming director in Justin Kurzel — coming off the Cannes-premiering “Macbeth” — who brought over much of his crew from that film, including the principle leads: the Oscar-nominated Michael Fassbender and the Oscar-winning Marion Cotillard. Throw in the esteemed Jeremy Irons, Charlotte Rampling and Brendan Gleeson, and it appeared to be the perfect storm to finally bring some class to the genre. Yet, despite the promise, the story is a total mess. Replicating the game’s Assassins-versus-Knights-Templar basis, the film never fully establishes either groups’ goal, other than that the Templars are looking for the “Apple of Eden” — a metallic apple that represents man’s first disobedience. If this apple can be captured, the Templars can control mankind’s free will and, thus, the world. Throw in some Catholic imagery, and the Templars represent the very worst that religion has to offer. So here is where the Assassins come in: They are a “brotherhood” formed to prevent the Templars by any means necessary — typically assassinations (makes sense) — from retrieving the Apple, in order to keep free will a possibility for all humans. For the most part, this setup makes sense and admirably condenses the convoluted lore that the video games were able to build off of for 14 installments now. But then the film gets bogged down with over-plotting, adding the modern timeline (one of the least successful transfers from the games) of Callum Lynch (Fassbender), a murderer on death row, being taken by a leading scientist Sofia Rikkin (Cotillard) of Abstergo Industries to take part in the company’s “Animus Project.” In this game-referencing project, Sofia intends on sending Callum back to the Spanish Inquisition through his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha, to assassinate the Templars close to gaining control of the Apple. How this Animus works is never given an explanation, and how each detail of the past and present connects is supposed to be taken for granted. But really, the story seems only half-finished. The way the story plays out seems like it would be better suited for an eight-hour miniseries on HBO or Netflix, or some other company willing to pay the necessary budget, in a longform setting that can give the complexity of the story its due. Worst of all, though, the characters are thinly written. While Fassbender and Cotillard are fully committed to their roles — the former is physically ripped, bringing his trademark intensity — the characters are hard to care for. They are devoid of personality and their motivations to take part in this project are poorly explained. On top of that, the dialogue is laughably bad at times. There is an important sequence that uses the line “I’m hungry” three times just to show off another set piece. It’s not certain whether it’s intended for laughs or just a lazy excuse for exposition. Despite the fundamental issues with the story, there are some excellently shot crowd-pleasing sequences for gamers and cinephiles alike. Shot by lenser Adam Arkapaw — who also worked on Kurzel’s “Macbeth” and the other Fassbender-starring “The Light Between Oceans” — the film replicates the lighting of the original game. The scenes taking place in ancient Spain are gorgeously filled with yellow tints and hues. Even more importantly, Arkapaw’s cinematography and Christopher Tellefsen’s work as editor perfectly capture the kinetic energy of the game’s action. When Fassbender’s Aguilar is shown in beautifully staged and furiously paced chase sequences on top of buildings, relying on extremely physical parkour and brutal knife-to-sword combat, it’s hard not to see the increasingly bright future in store for video game adaptations. While it’s not a winning accomplishment — and it’s nowhere close to one by standards outside of those applied to video-game-to-movie attempts — “Assassin’s Creed” is a step in the right direction. Maybe next time, like the main characters in the film and the games, the studios will take a greater “leap of faith” and acquire better scripts for the lauded talent in front of and behind the screen.    Contact Levi Hill at [email protected] .

Plans for the watch version had been announced at Apple’s iPhone launch event in September. (AP Photo/Thomas Cytrynowicz) The game involves catching digital pocket monsters in an augmented-reality version of your surroundings. The Apple Watch version will let you discover nearby Pokemon and collect special items, such as potions, from nearby “PokeStops.” But once you encounter a Pokemon, you will need to use your iPhone to catch it. Still, the Apple Watch should make it easier for players to log their steps (needed to advance in the game and to hatch new Pokemon out of eggs), and to avoid walking around with their phones held out to search for nearby monsters. “Pokemon Go” was a huge success when it came out in July. It’s not clear how the Apple Watch version will do, especially now that it’s too cold in much of the Northern Hemisphere to be outside catching Pokemon. Plans for the watch version had been announced at Apple’s iPhone launch event in September. The game’s maker, Niantic, hasn’t announced any plans for Android Wear and Samsung Gear smartwatches.

European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager said on Aug. 30 that Apple must pay up to €13 billion ($13.6 billion) in back taxes, plus interest, because opinions given by the Irish tax authorities in 1991 and 2007 constituted illegal state aid. Her decision concluded a two-year investigation of the company's tax affairs stretching back to 2003. Apple CEO Tim Cook dismissed Vestager's ruling as "total political crap" in an interview with the Irish Independent newspaper on Sept. 2, and announced the company's intention to appeal. Over three months later, Apple is now ready to file that appeal with the General Court, the European Union's second highest court, the company's General Counsel Bruce Sewell and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview published Sunday. The Irish government decided to appeal the ruling alongside Apple, and on Monday the country's Department of Finance published an outline of its arguments, saying the Commission misunderstood the relevant facts and Irish law. The Commission is wrong to claim that the 1991 and 2007 tax opinions "renounced" tax revenue to which the country would otherwise have been entitled; Instead, the department's argument goes, the opinions correctly applied Irish tax law in only taxing the profit attributable to Apple's Irish branch, and not the company's non-Irish profits. The case presented by the Commission revolved around the activities of the Irish branches of Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE). These branches carried out routine functions but all important decisions were made in the U.S., so profit deriving from those decisions should not be attributed to ASI and AOE, according to the department. Furthermore, the department said, the Commission tried to apply principles that do not exist in Irish tax law, failed to follow required procedures, wrongly invoked novel legal rules, and exceeded its powers and interfered with Irish sovereignty. A summary of the Irish government's legal arguments will be published in the Official Journal of the EU before the court hears the case. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Apple annual announces a holiday schedule, presumably to give some of the real people behind the app management process some time off. However, this year the break is only 5 days vs. 7 the past couple of years. While developers won't be able to submit new apps or updates during the break, they will have access to other iTunes connect features. Apple recently announced its Best of 2016 list, highlighting top apps and developers. Statista shows that about 2 million mobile apps are available for download on the Apple App Store, including the top new free app (well, it costs $10 to activate the good stuff), Super Mario Run. Nintendo says Super Mario Run was downloaded 40 million times in its first 4 days of availability, and Apple confirmed that is a record-breaker. So those of you forced to wait a few days before submitting new apps in to Apple's system, there's a goal for you... 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Refurbished first-gen Apple Watch units now available at 14 to 16 off on most models Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, December 22nd, 2016, 05:18 Category: Apple Watch, News, retail, Uncategorized, Wearables You can now snag a refurbished first-gen Apple Watch at a pretty decent savings. Apple has just posted its cheapest model, a refurbished Apple Watch Series 1 in a 38mm rose gold aluminum case, is only $229. Others, like stainless steel versions of the Apple Watch Series 2, are available for $509, or about 15 percent off. This move follows Apple’s recent decision to start selling refurbished iPhone models on its online store. The discounts generally range between 14 to 16 percent off throughout the entire range of models. Luxury goods buyers unfortunately won’t find the multi-thousand dollar Apple Watch Edition up for discount. The company notably left that eye-popping price tier, which originally included a 18-karat gold case and a five-digit price tag, out of its Series 2 refresh back in September. Instead, the company sells a ceramic version that costs about a tenth of the price.

And it includes support for the Apple Watch. Version 1.21.2, which just hit, includes the following fixes and changes: – Pokemon GO for Apple Watch. – Minor text fixes. There are several references to new Apple Watch faces and interactions available via this along with tie-ins to the main Pokemon GO app. As of now, it’s unknown as to whether the app coordinates with Apple’s HealthKit and whether the watch itself will be involved in tracking distances traveled. The main app will ‘know’ when a watch is paired with the app, and appears to be able to push notifications to the watch. Pokemon GO 1.12.1 is available for free and requires iOS 8.0 or later to install and run. If you get a chance to try out Pokemon GO on your Apple Watch, please let us know about the experience in the comments.
