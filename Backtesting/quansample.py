# This is a sample mean-reversion algorithm on Quantopian for you to test and adapt.

# Algorithm investment thesis:  
# Top-performing stocks from last week will do worse this week, and vice-versa.

# Every Monday, we rank high-volume stocks based on their previous 5 day returns.  
# We go long the bottom 20% of stocks with the WORST returns over the past 5 days.  
# We go short the top 20% of stocks with the BEST returns over the past 5 days.

# This type of algorithm may be used in live trading and in the Quantopian Open.
