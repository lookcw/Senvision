# Senvision
Welcome to the Senvision Git! 
Here you'll find our work on sentiment analysis, specifically using NLTK, scikit-learn, and Theanos, among others.
We have Tweet and news article streaming infrastructure.
We have algorithms on Quantopian to back-test our strategies and give us an idea of our returns.
We have financial stock data from Quandl.
